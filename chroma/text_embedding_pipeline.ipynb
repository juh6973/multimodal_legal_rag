The Mead Corporation\\'s imported \"day planners,\" were classified as duty-free until the Customs Headquarters issued a ruling letter classifying them as bound diaries subject to tariff. Subsequently, Mead filed suit in the Court of International Trade. The court granted the Government summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Appeals found that ruling letters should not be treated like Customs regulations, which receive the highest level of deference, because they are not preceded by notice and comment as under the Administrative Procedure Act, do not carry the force of law, and are not intended to clarify importers\\'s rights and obligations beyond the specific case.

Mead Corporation.\\nMr. Jones.\\nMr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:\\nThe harmonized tariff schedule employs more than 9,000 individual categories and more than half-a-million words to classify every conceivable article of commerce for tariff purposes.\\nThis massive document was drafted initially by an international commission, and in 1988 it was enacted in its entirety as a law of the United States.\\nTwo terms ago in the Haggar case this Court held that courts should defer to the reasonable interpretive regulations adopted by the customs service to implement these complex tariff provisions.\\nIn the present case, however, the Federal Circuit held that it would give no weight whatever to the interpretive rulings adopted by the customs service to apply the tariff provisions in specific situations under the very same statutory provisions.\\nThe court, having concluded it would give no deference to the agency rulings, then held that the particular item involved in this case, known as a date planner, would not constitute a bound diary within the specific meaning of the tariff provision we have here before us.\\nIn our view, the court's method of analysis and its ultimate classification determination are both incorrect.\\nIn enacting a harmonized tariff schedule, Congress specified that... its understanding and intent that the customs service would be responsible for interpreting and applying these provisions, and for that purpose Congress gave broad and varied types of interpretive authority to the agency.\\nIn particular, in 19 U.S.C. 1502, Congress provided that the agency could adopt rules and regulations for the classifications of goods under the tariff schedules, and it was under that provision that this Court applied Chevron and Haggar to say that reasonable interpretations of ambiguous provisions set forth in regulations should be applied by the courts.\\nNow, Congress understood, however, that the regulations alone would not be sufficient to address the infinite myriad of small interpretive problems that arise under this kind of tariff legislation, and so Congress specified and gave authority to the agency to adopt binding interpretive rules for the purpose of applying the statute in these discrete situations.\\nMr. Jones, there is kind of a curious feature.\\nAs I understand it, if a case on a tariff ruling were to go to the Court of International Trade--\\nYes.\\n--as I understand it, it engages in de novo review of the classification rulings?\\nI think the... we have used that expressing in describing it--\\nYes.\\n--but as the Court pointed out in Haggar, and as we have argued in these two cases, what really happens is there is a de novo fact-finding on the record made in the Court of International Trade.\\nDo you think that court affords some kind of deference to the views of the customs service, and would it be some kind of deference to the ruling such as we have here?\\nWell, Haggar also pointed out that what the court does is, in determining what the law is that it applies these facts to, it looks to the agency's interpretations, and we think it should look to the agency's rulings.\\nThat's--\\nAnd you think that's clear?\\n--Yes.\\nAnd what kind of deference to do they give it?\\nIs it Chevron, or something less--\\nWell, what they have--\\n--such as so-called Skidmore, and what are you urging us is the proper rule?\\n--Our... what we are urging you is that it is the deference that the Court described in Chevron, that is that you... that the Court is to defer to the reasonable interpretations set forth in these binding rulings, and what... in the NationsBank v. Variable Annuity case the Court described these as a deliberative conclusions set forth in the agency's interpretations.\\nBut not adopted after notice and comment, and so is there some lesser kind of deference, such as suggested in the Skidmore case?\\nNot in this context.\\nI mean, let me point out that when we're talking about interpretive rulings they are routinely initiated by the importer themselves.\\nThe importer has ample opportunity to make comments on how they think this procedure should be... how that statute should be interpreted, and when the agency... if the agency adopts that interpretation and then some other importer doesn't agree and they want to ask for a different ruling, they can submit and request an interpretive ruling, and that's what's--\\nHow does this differ from the Labor Department ruling in Christiansen, which we said was not entitled to Chevron deference?\\n--In Christiansen the Court said that there was an informal opinion stated in a format that Congress had not provided for official interpretations.\\nHere, we have a formal provision of Congress directing the agency to make these kinds of interpretive determinations and to make them in a binding way.\\nIt was dictum in Christiansen anyway, wasn't it?\\nDidn't the Court find that it wasn't a reasonable interpretation?\\nI believe that's correct.\\nThe Court concluded that it was not, in the words of Skidmore, entitled to any consideration because it wasn't persuasive, but I... clearly the Court was of the view that it was not a reasonable interpretation, and--\\nMr. Jones, could we just back up a bit?\\nYour answer to Justice O'Connor about the Court of International Trade owing some deference--\\n--Yes.\\n--to the customs rulings, as far as I recall, in this very case, although the Court of International Trade upheld the customs classification, there wasn't one word that they said, so we don't know from this case what position the Court of International Trade takes on this question.\\nWell, historically we know the court said that it would defer to reasonable interpretations of the service, but in this... you're very right about the oddity of the specific issue, the way it came up, and we addressed that at the petition stage.\\nWhat happened was that when Haggar was before this Court, the United States did not press the lower court to apply what is now to be called Haggar or Chevron deference because the Federal Circuit had said in Haggar that it would give no weight to customs service interpretations, and so at the time the case was in the Court of International Trade, that court was not asked to give that type of deference to the agency's interpretation--\\nBut the--\\n--because that was the law of the circuit.\\nOnce this Court reversed the circuit ruling in Haggar, this... the Federal Circuit then addressed how the principles of Haggar and Chevron applied.\\n--But that didn't happen until the case was in--\\nIn the Federal Circuit, but I would point out that respondent has agreed, and we think it's clear that the Court of International Trade applied the same definition of bound diary that the ruling sets forth.\\n--May I ask you before we get to the specific ruling, you're asserting that there should be deference equivalent to Chevron deference.\\nYes.\\nAnd yet, as I understand it, there are two features of this that would lead me to hesitate about that.\\nOne is that the vast majority of these rulings, as I understand it, are just you'll classify this, you'll classify that, with no reasons elaborated, and the other is that you don't have one decisionmaker, as you would have, say, for the EPA.\\nInstead, you have decisions that are dispersed among 45 ports of entry.\\nWell, let me address the second point first.\\nI think in Smiley v. Citibank the Court had a similar situation where there was a subsidiary determination that was then reviewed by the headquarters office to result in a final agency determination, which is the process that we've gone through with respect to these rulings, and the Court said, well, that doesn't result in a change of view, it results in a proper application of the agency's ruling process.\\nWith respect to the first point, the respondent says, well, there are 10,000 a year of these kinds of rulings made in the head... in the regional offices.\\nIn fact, we do not claim that there's... we are unaware of any of those rulings in which there would be what the Court, in the opinion you authored for the Court in the Variable Annuity case call the deliberative conclusions.\\nIt is only the deliberative conclusions that set forth the actual interpretations of provisions that the Court can look to to defer to.\\nIt's not simply the result.\\nAnd in most of the simple tariff entry at issue determinations, of course it's a very simplified procedure.\\nIt has to be, because of the volume of transactions at issue, and those kinds of entry-level port determinations are very simple, and the Trade Bar Association brief acknowledges they contain in almost every instance no discussion.\\nThey just contain the sort of a statement that 12 apples come in as apples.\\nCan't you appeal that within the agency?\\nYes, and the agency has--\\nDon't you have to appeal it within the agency before you go to court?\\n--I don't believe you have to.\\nI--\\nYou don't have to?\\n--The agency... it's an election of the importer whether he wants, whether he can ask... he can ask the headquarters for a ruling in the first instance.\\nHe can ask the headquarters to review a field determination.\\nAnd you'd say that any ruling by the headquarters either on review or as an original matter is entitled to Chevron deference.\\nThat is correct.\\nTo the extent--\\nBut not the rulings that come out of the field and are not reviewed.\\n--As a practical matter, that's true, but I would say that either of them would be entitled to deference to the extent they contain deliberative conclusions, and I'm just being finicky about that because as a practical matter the entry-level port determinations don't contain those kinds of--\\nWhy is that?\\nI mean, if it comes out of headquarters it's obviously been considered at a high level within the agency and they say, this is the answer.\\nWhy should--\\n--I think as a practical matter the agency would have no objection to a determination of that type.\\nIt's just, all I'm addressing is the logical basis by which the Court would reach such a determination.\\n--Well, but I mean, if we're going to use that criteria... you see, I thought Chevron was just, if it's an authoritative agency position we defer to it, but if you're going to hang qualifications on that, that is, it has to be an authoritative agency position that is explicated in written opinion, you might as well add the fillips that your brother suggests, which is only those rulings that are the product of formal rulemaking.\\nThe one is as logical to me as the other.\\nWell, the... I'm not... I think what I'm trying to describe and not doing a very good job at it is simply that it's up to what... the ultimate question is what did Congress intend?\\nHow did Congress intend the agency to function?\\nThe best evidence of that is probably the agency's regulations pursuant to the authority that Congress gave the agency to provide for a binding ruling program.\\nThe agency's regulations specify that the port service's rulings are precedential and binding, but they don't go on to say, because it's up to this Court to say, the extent to which those precedential binding determinations are to be given deference by the courts, and all I was trying to say was that it seems to me that when this Court has addressed interpretive rulings in prior cases, like Variable Annuity, PBGC v. LTC, it has looked to the question of whether the... you can look to the interpretation expressed by the agency--\\nWell--\\n--and find in it a reasoned--\\n--Well, you say that Christiansen was not an interpretive ruling?\\n--Not in the sense that we're using that term in this case.\\nWhat Christiansen was was the private correspondence that was sent--\\nWell, private correspondence by the Secretary of Labor, wasn't it?\\n--Well, actually it was sent by the Wage & Hour Division of the Labor Department.\\nOkay, but you wouldn't call that... those people are paid by the Government.\\nRight, but what the... but I think what this... the Court's concern in Christiansen was that there was no evidence that that was an official interpretation of the type that Congress had authorized the agency to use to interpret the statute.\\nHere, we have a statute that expressly tells the agency to make these kinds of binding determinations, and the agency's done it just the way Congress said.\\nWell, could you go back for a second on that to the first question that Justice O'Connor put to you, and she said there's a statute that says, in effect, that the Court of International Trade is to review these things de novo, to which you replied no, it's just reviewing matters of fact.\\nYes.\\nBut my copy of the statute says nothing about matters of fact.\\nWhat it says is, the Court of International Trade shall make its determinations upon the basis of the record before the court.\\nThe importers tell us, the textile importers tell us there's hardly ever a dispute of fact.\\nYou know, this is what it is.\\nEverybody knows that, that almost all these things concern how you apply a tariff or... to the facts and the Customs Trade Bar tells us that if we set down the distinction you want to make between facts and application of the tariff, this whole thing's unworkable, because people would never be able to figure out, or hardly ever, what's going on, which is which.\\nSo that would seem to be a pretty strong argument that Justice O'Connor's initial characterization was right as opposed to the application of these tariffs, and I'd like you to respond to that.\\nThe function of the interpretive binding ruling program is to make the system more workable by providing effective advanced guidance.\\nThey didn't say that was unworkable.\\nWhat they said would be unworkable would be for the Court of International Trade to figure out, you know, is it a question of fact, is it a determination of application of the tariff, et cetera.\\nIt's... this... I believe the Court has already addressed this very point in the Haggar case.\\nChevron deference is about how you decide what the law is.\\nThere are other doctrines, burden of proof, presumption of regularity, that go to about how you decide what facts are and how the facts apply to law.\\nChevron is simply a doctrine about how does a court decide what the law is, and in this case the agency made a determination about legal issues and said what it believed a diary was, for example, or what it believed the law, properly interpreted was, bound for this purpose is.\\nHaving made that legal determination, it's then up to the Court of International Trade to decide whether these facts represent such an item.\\nOf course, the agency's binding rulings state its own view of what the facts are and how they apply to these legal interpretations, but that's what the Court of International Trade has the right to do de novo, to decide whether these facts fit within the legal determination, the legal interpretation that the agency has expressed in the binding ruling.\\nSuppose we were to hold--\\nIt's just like tax cases.\\n--Suppose we were to hold that Chevron deference applies to regulations that are adopted under the EPA with notice and comment, and that this does not qualify, but that this ruling, or this determination gets a Skidmore deference.\\nDo you think that the courts would find that that's a meaningful difference?\\nOh, this is just a Skidmore case and therefore I can rule as follows.\\nIf it had been a Chevron case, I would have to rule--\\nWell, addressing your practical question before I... I do want to respond to your question about how this might be looked at.\\nYour practical question is, does it make a difference.\\nYes, it makes a big difference.\\n--Okay.\\nBecause if we... if you had the sort of sliding scale approach of the Skidmore doctrine, then no one would know until the end of the day what... you know, how much... how effective the agency's interpretation is, and the advantage of the Chevron approach, if you needed to look at it in a practical sense, is that everyone knows at the outset what the effectiveness of the agency's interpretation is.\\nIt's to be upheld if it's reasonable.\\nNow, I would like to point out that this Court has never held, and would have to overrule several cases if it did now, that Chevron deference requires that the agency issue this regulation with notice and comment.\\nThere are cases in which this Court--\\nI understand.\\n--Okay.\\nIn one of your earlier responses, your first response I think to Justice O'Connor, you said, oh, no, Skidmore deference would be inappropriate.\\nAs a fallback position, if we say, no Chevron deference, I assume you would urge some sort of Skidmore--\\nI would assume that if the Court were to conclude that Chevron deference didn't apply it would then conclude Skidmore was an appropriate formula to look at this issue under.\\n--But you say Skidmore is inappropriate in order to urge upon us Chevron--\\nI don't really remember having used that phrasing.\\nWhat I... I think Chevron's analysis is appropriate.\\nThis Court's applied it in other interpretive ruling situations, and only in that sense is Skidmore inappropriate.\\n--Mr. Jones, you said something very quickly, but I wanted to be sure I understood your position about tax rulings, revenue rulings.\\nYes.\\nHow do they compare to customs classifications, and if you could just... probably you made this clear already.\\nYou are not claiming deference for just stamped, this, that.\\nThat's right.\\nIt's only when we have a reasoned decision as we do in this case.\\nOkay.\\nRight.\\nWith respect to revenue rulings, the history on this is sort of interesting, and it'll take me a minute to explain it all.\\nIn United States v. Correll, this Court held that revenue rulings should be upheld when they're reasonable, and the Court emphasized that it was based on the expertise of the agency and the fact, to quote the Court, that it doesn't sit as a committee of revision to perfect the administration of the tax laws.\\nThe Congress told the agency to do that by authorizing it to issue all necessary rules and regs.\\nNow, the tax counsel amici says no, that case was really about a regulation, not about a ruling.\\nWell, that's simply and flatly, clearly wrong.\\nThe regulation they cite had something to do with the procedures as used to make a claim for a deduction.\\nWhen Justice Marshall was Solicitor General, he filed the Government's brief in the Correll case.\\nHis successor, Solicitor General Griswold, filed a reply brief.\\nNeither of those briefs mention any regulation.\\nThey rely just on the revenue ruling of the service and ask the Court to defer to it, which is what Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court said was appropriate.\\nBut that was pre-Chevron, so we don't know--\\nYes.\\n--exactly what they meant by deference.\\nWell, we know exactly what they meant, if we... I mean, reading the opinion it says that the agency's reasonable interpretation should be accepted.\\nIt was a pre-Chevron Chevron case.\\nWell, have we addressed this issue post-Chevron?\\nThat's where it became confusing, and there's a nomenclature shift that occurred that really hasn't been addressed.\\nPrior to the 1960's, there were two kinds of rulings.\\nThere were Treasury decisions issued by the Secretary, and there were Commissioner's rulings that were published in what's called the Cumulative Bulletin.\\nThe Cumulative Bulletin pointed out before 1960 that the Commissioner's rulings were not approved by the Secretary, therefore they weren't binding on the agency.\\nIn 1961, the Commissioner was given interpretive authority in a regulation we've cited in our brief, and that interpretive authority is subject, however, to the approval of the Secretary, and since that time, what are now called Revenue Rules, with a capital R, are issued by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.\\nThey are functionally the same as Treasury decisions were before 1960, and in the cases before 1960 the Court had pointed out Treasury decisions were entitled to substantial deference, and even in Skidmore the Court pointed out they were often decisive.\\nAfter Correll... I'm sorry.\\nAfter Correll and indeed, I think after Chevron, but in any event in that time frame, Justice Marshall wrote an opinion for the Court, bringing this full circle, in which he said that a Treasury decision issued in connection with a customs ruling should be given... should be accepted if it's reasonably... if it's sufficiently reasonable.\\nThat's the way... that's why I pointed out that revenue rulings and Treasury decisions and customs interpretive rulings have followed a path that should lead to the same result.\\nBut here we're... we get back to something you've already talked about, which is a little curious.\\nAs I understand it, the customs maybe issues over 12,000 classification decisions annually, and only some of them involve some kind of legal conclusion, or explanation.\\nRight.\\nAnd you would say it's only the latter that deserve Chevron deference?\\nI would say only to the extent that they contain that kind of deliberative conclusion that the Court--\\nBut not these thousands of rulings that are issued every year.\\n--There isn't an interpretation stated in a ruling of the type they're talking about, which simply says an apple's an apple.\\nMr. Jones, could I ask just one clarifying question?\\nI'm having difficulty drawing the line between what it is the international court has to do de novo and what is entitled to deference, and I thought you said that they're entitled to deference if they're applying... they're deciding whether a particular item fits within the rule, whether a particular document as we have here is a diary or not.\\nWhy isn't that the very thing that's supposed to be decided de novo under what's--\\nBecause to decide that they have to know what a diary is, and that's a legal conclusion.\\nIt's like instructing a jury.\\nThe jury is instructed that a diary means these things, and then the jury decides whether this thing is a diary under that set of definitions.\\nThat's what Haggar said.\\nHaggar said that it's... there's nothing inconsistent with the responsibility of the Court of International Trade to make this de novo--\\n--But isn't that always what the Court of International Trade does, is decide whether the item that is presented... there are no disputing the facts about what the item is, whether it is the particular thing described in the rule?\\nIsn't that what they always do?\\n--But they... to make that second step, they have to know what the law is and all... and what Haggar said and what we think is clear in Chevron cases generally, is that in deciding what the law is the Court should defer to the agency's reasonable interpretations.\\nIt might be that I can make this clearer by focusing on the facts of this case, which would probably be useful in any event.\\nIn this case, the agency said that--\\nMr. Jones, just before you get there, and in this picture of deference based on, among other things, expertise, does the Federal Circuit in the Government's view owe any deference to the Court of International Trade?\\n--I believe the decisions of the Court of International Trade are reviewed like the decisions--\\nOf a district court, and no special credit is given to the specialization of the Court of International Trade?\\n--That's correct.\\nI mean, of course, to the extent that the Court of International Trade makes factual determinations, then its determinations--\\nBut it would be just like a district court?\\n--It would be just like a district court.\\nAre you going to finish your answer to--\\nIn this specific--\\n--and then I have a question.\\n--Okay.\\nIn this specific case, the agency, in our view, reasonably concluded that the definition of a diary, which the agency found from a dictionary to be--\\nWell, I understand that, but what is it that the International Trade... the Court of... was supposed to do in this case?\\nWhat did they have to do de novo, just decide that that document--\\n--They're supposed to decide whether the--\\n--is what that document is?\\n--They're supposed to decide whether the item that has been brought to them--\\nRight.\\n--constitutes a bound diary, and in deciding whether it's a bound diary, they have to know what the law... what that legal definition is of a bound diary, and in deciding that, they're supposed to look to the agency's interpretation, if it's a reasonable one.\\nAnd again, I think I can make this more concrete by pointing out that the... here's the way it worked in this case.\\nThe ruling said that a diary is a book for the keeping of a record of daily events, and that that definition is broad enough to encompass the commercial usage of that term, which is a business diary, which has been commonly employed and, under cases like Stone and Downer, the agency and the courts are supposed to consider in deciding what the terms of the tariff provisions mean.\\nNow, what the court of appeals said was, well, we think that... we want to add two things to that.\\nWe want to say it has to be room for extensive notations, and it has to be retrospective, but the diary definition doesn't say that in the dictionary.\\nThere... you can find alternative dictionary definitions, and the commercial usage is inconsistent with that.\\nMr. Jones--\\nYes.\\n--why wouldn't a judgment that's made in the field, that isn't appealed, but once it gets into court, presumably the agency at a high level decides that this ruling, made out in the field, ought to be defended in court, why doesn't that represent an official agency endorsement of that position made in the field?\\nIt is an official agency position at that point.\\nThe problem I've had in giving an answer that's better on this for your... from your perspective is that I don't under... I think that if you look at the way these decisions are made at ports of entry, and the way they're intended to be made at ports of entry, there is little in the face of that document that gives a reasoned explanation of the agency's interpretation.\\nBy comparison, the headquarters rulings are thorough, they provide a definite description of the text, and internally the agency has advised its regional offices to not include a full discussion of text, and I'm going outside the record, but I have to answer your question, and internally the understanding is that if the issue is complicated enough it will get referred to the headquarters.\\nNow, that doesn't mean that complicated issues aren't resolved at the field office, but it does mean that when the field offices ordinarily determine them it's not with a deliberative explanation.\\nThat... to get that, you go to the headquarters.\\nMr. Jones, I want to get clear on two points about the deference that the agency itself gives to these rulings.\\nMy two questions are these.\\nFirst, with respect to the importer for whom the ruling was given in the first place, is it correct that the Government can always in effect withdraw the ruling as a precedent for future cases simply by telling the importer by letter or otherwise, you can't rely on this prior ruling?\\nNo.\\nMy second question is, would you explain what reliance someone other than the original importer can place on it?\\nWell, the statute and regulations specify that before a ruling that has been issued may be modified or overruled, public notice and comment, an opportunity to comment, has to be given.\\nThat's in 1625(c).\\nOkay, so they can't just withdraw it.\\nThey can't just withdraw it, and even when they change it for a period of 60 days there's an automatic protection of people who are using the old ruling.\\nIf I may reserve the balance of time for my--\\nVery well, Mr. Jones.\\nMr. Coll.\\nAm I pronouncing your name correctly?\\nYou are, sir.\\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\\nI'd like to start by picking up on a question that Justice Souter just asked, and that is, may it be revoked, may it be modified without further proceeding between the customs service and the importer, and at the time that these rulings issued, the answer to that is yes.\\nThere was no notice required.\\nAs the record reflects, in June of 1991 they classified this day planner as a unbound diary, duty free.\\nIn 1993, without notice, without any further proceeding, a letter was received from the customs service saying that that classification had been changed.\\nWith no waiting period?\\nNo.\\nWe--\\nSo that the very day of the notice, it became dutiable?\\n--We had the opportunity, which we took advantage of, which was to get a detrimental reliance letter from the customs service that said to the effect that those imports that were in process we were able to rely on the previous ruling, on the previous classification ruling, but that we could not rely in the future, so that the first revocation allowed us to take those orders that we had in process and bring them in duty free, but thereafter we now had duty attached.\\nNow, is there a different regulatory scheme in effect today?\\nThere is now a notice provision that requires publication in the Customs Bulletin.\\nIs that the one that's set forth in page 3 of the Government's brief?\\nI don't have it by the page, Your Honor, but I believe it is.\\n19 U.S.C. 1625?\\nThat's correct, and its reflected in the... in 19 C.F.R.--\\nBut that was not in force in the case before us?\\n--It was not.\\nIt was not in force at that time.\\nThere was... there's a second notice provision that has been raised by the Government in its brief, and that relates to change in practice, but this was not a change in practice, either, as the courts have defined that particular regulation, so that the importer here received a classification ruling in 1991.\\nIt was revoked in 1993 without further proceeding.\\nNow--\\nNow, with respect... with respect to reliance by someone other than the original importer, as I recall the briefs there was a difference of opinion between you and Mr. Jones on that, and I think his response to you was that the... that someone other than the original importer can rely unless notice is given by the Government.\\nHave you resolved your difference on that?\\n--Well, I think it's probably a matter of practice as much as it is a matter of the interpretation of the rules, or the regulations.\\nUnder 19 C.F.R. 177.9 it sets forth very clearly who may rely on a particular classification ruling.\\nThe importer may rely who has sought the classification ruling on that ruling for those goods in similar circumstances.\\nThat is who may definitely rely.\\nOther importers may rely, may... but they are not certain that it is even in effect any longer because of the way the rule... because of the way the service runs its classification rulings, and it says... and this is where the Solicitor General took me to task, I think, is that there's a second sentence that says, if you want to know what the current ruling is, you can contact us and by the way, send us enough information so we can figure out what it is that may pertain to you, so it is not--\\nSo they... in any case they can get a prospective determination as long as they're on their toes.\\n--I don't think it's a prospective determination.\\nWhat they can get is a current status of how a particular good has been classified for a particular importer at a given point in time.\\nWell, does--\\nWhether--\\n--I should have the reg in front of me and I don't, but does the reg say anything about the reliance that may be placed upon a ruling once the Government has said yes, this ruling is still in effect?\\n--No, I don't believe it does.\\nThe problem here, as I see it, to ask for Chevron deference, which I view as mandatory, controlling weight deference, rather than Skidmore deference--\\nWell, on that point, Mr. Coll, this Court had a holding in NationsBank v. Variable Annuity Life Insurance where we held that a letter ruling by the Comptroller of the Currency warranted Chevron deference.\\nHow is this different?\\n--Well, I would focus on the question in that case as posed by Justice Ginsburg, which said, may or can national banks in the United States sell variable annuities, question mark, and that was... as I understood that question, viewed by this Court, that ruling was now going to be applicable to every national bank in the United States and as I've just discussed--\\nWell, I suppose that we can assume that the customs service made clear that it thought that anything like a filofax here with the little entry spaces on pages in a loose-leaf binder met the definition.\\nApparently that was their idea.\\n--I don't think we can assume that.\\nNo?\\nI don't think we can assume that.\\nThe problem is that by definition of the regulations of the service itself, these are applications of the customs law to the specific facts presented by the importer, and--\\nWell, would you concede that at least the customs has taken the position that a loose-leaf ring binder is bound?\\nI mean, they at least said that, apparently.\\n--For purposes of 4820 I think we can.\\nI don't know--\\nWhat do you mean, of 4820?\\nA statute?\\n--The statute, I'm sorry.\\nThere's a statute--\\nA statute of--\\n--that refers to bound diaries, right?\\n--19 U.S.A. section 4820.\\nOh, but that's all that we're talking about.\\nI mean, that's... in applying that to any other importer, surely you anticipated that the agency would take the same position.\\nThe agency can't say for one importer it... you know, a ring binder is okay, for another importer it isn't.\\nI mean, once they make that ruling, don't you know that the agency has taken that position of law?\\nWell, we don't know that under the particular section of 177.9 of their regulations, because they tell us similar articles, or identical articles or similar circumstances, and therefore they hedge that relative to every importer who comes to a dock--\\nWell, surely it means similar relevant circumstances.\\nYou... they can say, you know, you have blond hair and the other guy had brown hair.\\nYou think that they'd say, not similar circumstances?\\n--I don't know.\\nI'd suspect not, but I don't know.\\nBut what we have here, just to look at the record, we start out in 1991 with an identical... the same product that we had in 1993 and that we had in 1994, when it made it into headquarters and their view changed.\\nAh, but the exact question I think is, I could imagine... it's all hypothetical... being a Member of Congress and if I were asked, do you really want the Comptroller of the Currency to have some binding authority when he writes a letter answering the question that was posed, you'd say, yeah, that's a pretty good idea.\\nHe knows quite a lot about these things.\\nThen similarly, if you were a Member of Congress, you might say, would you want these several thousand customs inspectors to have the authority of whether the word bound does or does not include these ring binders?\\nWell, you might say yeah, they know a lot about it, similar answer.\\nNow, there's a lot of confusion getting to whether you get a firm position, but if you get a firm position at the agency, yes, defer to that.\\nThat's the question.\\nThat's why I thought maybe your stronger point was the statute.\\nWell--\\nAnd I'd like to hear both the answer to that question and something about the statute.\\n--Well, I'd like to go to what Congress may have said with regard to whether or not the customs service should be binding, and we looked to the legislative history in 1979 with regard to de novo review, and that legislative history said, in light of the Zenith Radio case it's precedents suggested that deference should be given to the customs service rulings, that--\\nOn most of these things Congress says nothing.\\nWhat you're trying to do is make sense of some kind of statutory scheme.\\nLooking at the scheme, would it make sense to give the power to make somewhat binding rulings under Chevron to this particular official in this kind of instance under these circumstances.\\nI--\\nSo that's how I'd look at it.\\n--And responding to that question--\\nYes.\\n--I believe the answer is no, that Skidmore deference would be appropriate, but Chevron deference would be inappropriate.\\nTo--\\nI don't understand.\\nWhat is the criterion for just saying we're going to give deference to, you know, formerly adopted regulations?\\nI can understand a criterion that tries to assess whether the agency's view that has been expressed is authoritative, but surely the agency's view on this issue has been authoritatively expressed in this case by the Solicitor General.\\nI mean, we know that the agency believes that this is what the law says.\\nNow, why should we give one sort of deference if the agency tells us that in a regulation with notice and comment and another kind of deference if it comes to us in some other fashion?\\nSo long as it's the agency's authoritative view, what difference should it make?\\n--Well, that question, as I would understand it, starts from the premise that we're going to somehow narrow this field of classification rulings from the 10 to 15,000 that issue each year to some smaller group that purportedly are qualitatively better, certainly quantitatively less, and if that's the case, then I think we also need to not lose sight of the fact that these are mixed conclusions of fact and law, even when articulated.\\nAnd for example, in our particular ruling, the third ruling, the one that I assume the Solicitor General says that the deference to attach... should attach to, not the earlier ones, the last.\\nThere, the... Mr. Durant, who was the fellow who exercised that discretion, that interpretation, and who signed that letter, says that he has reached his interpretation on the basis of factual analysis, ex parte factual analysis, ex parte to anything that this importer had an opportunity to respond to.\\nIt says... this is at 32a of... it begins at the bottom of 31a.\\nIt's 32a in the petition for the writ of certiorari, and it says, the rationale for this determination was based on lexicographic sources as well as extrinsic evidence of how these types of articles are treated in the trade and commerce of the United States.\\nNow, that record was made--\\nMr. Coll, does that get a presumption of deference... of correctness?\\nThat's the other piece of this statute, that this Court of International Trade is supposed to accord decisions of customs a presumption of correctness, is that right, and that's statutory?\\n--That's correct, and it's as to facts, and it's part of the process.\\nI mean, this process--\\nYou're getting into the same problem that we have in discussing this with Mr. Jones, what is fact as opposed to law in these customs classifications?\\n--Exactly.\\nWhat we have here--\\nWell, gee, I don't think that... you say, was based on lexicographic sources.\\nI assume he's talking about dictionaries.\\nNow, I guess you can say it is a question of fact whether dictionaries say this or that.\\nI mean, everything in the world is a question of fact, but when we issue a ruling on a point of law that relies in part on dictionaries, I don't consider that a mixed... a ruling on a mixed question of fact and law, did the dictionary say this and is it accurate that that produces this result.\\n--It's--\\nAnd the other one is extrinsic evidence of how these types of articles are treated in the trade and commerce of the United States.\\nI mean, I don't... you know, if that is a factual question, it is a factual question of the generic type that we usually subsume under the term of judicial notice.\\nI mean, what do people usually think of diaries as?\\nYou can call that a question of fact, if you like, but my goodness, I think that's still a legal determination.\\n--Well, I beg to differ.\\nI think it is a question of fact.\\nThe Government, the... as well as the importer treat it as a question of fact.\\nOn the filing of the action in the Court of International Trade, both parties filed... the... both parties filed affidavits, affidavits relating to the facts, relating to commercial use, relating to commercial jargon as to how these products were described within the trade, and so both sides here treated that portion as being an item of fact.\\nAnd I don't think that it makes much sense, when we talk Chevron deference, we talk about the Haggar case, which says that Haggar stems... that deference stems from the creation of a legal norm, to put to the Court on a mandatory basis deference that has a mixed question of fact, or a mixed conclusion of fact and law, and say to them, now, you may apply whatever that is to what remains of the facts.\\nWell, but that's a different point that you should be arguing, then, not that all these rulings are not entitled to deference, but rather that the ruling in this case is not a ruling purely of law, but it involves factual matters and therefore should get, indeed, de novo review if it went to the Court of International Trade.\\nThat goes to the second question that was certified, which is... and we approach it under Skidmore... does this have persuasive effect, the power to persuade, and we say it has absolutely none for any number of reasons.\\nMr. Coll you were--\\n--Do you accept what Justice Scalia just said... I'm quite curious about that... that, I'd thought the difference between this and Smiley is, here there is a specific statute, and that statue says that the Court of International Trade will make its determinations de novo?\\nNow, the Government says that that word, determinations, means simply matters of fact, not matters of whether, given agreement about the facts, this is a bound or unbound thing for purposes of the tariff.\\nIs that... in other words, do you agree with what... he wasn't saying it particularly, but I mean, do you agree with that characterization, that determinations cover only matters of fact?\\nNo.\\nNo.\\nWhy not?\\nBecause I don't think the one can dissect even this, what the Solicitor General would concede is as elaborate a classification ruling as one normally finds that one can dissect the fact from the law.\\nWell then, do you disagree with Haggar?\\nWell, Haggar--\\nIt sounds to me like you're disagreeing with Haggar in your answer to Justice Breyer.\\n--Haggar is a much different situation, Your Honor.\\nHaggar arose when Congress passed a particular provision of the tariff schedule that left a gap to be filled, and they delegated that filling of the gap, specific gap to the customs service.\\nIt was matters incidental to assembly outside of the United States, and it listed such as, it left obvious gaps for filling.\\nThey went, and on a notice and comment basis, had a regulation promulgated that furthered that definition.\\nI don't view it as interpretive.\\nI view it as legislative, and that's what the customs service did, and this Court found that that created normal law similar to a statute.\\nThat--\\nWhy didn't that constrain or modify or elaborate the term, de novo, in the Court of International Trade's jurisdictional standards, just as much as this case does?\\n--It impacted it in a slightly different fashion.\\nIt impacted it in that there was no interpretation left of the law.\\nthe statute, or the... it... the promulgation of the regulation, notice and comment regulation now told us, this is what is or isn't incidental.\\nNow we had... the question that remained was what had occurred outside of the United States, and did that fall within that language, so that now we were focused, as I understand this Court's direction, on that fact, what was happening outside the United States, and does it fit into that articulated definition in the regulation.\\nMr. Coll, let me approach this from a different vantage point.\\nIf we decide that we do owe Chevron deference to the position taken by the customs service in this case, do you lose?\\nIs that the end of the matter?\\nNo, because--\\nWhy not?\\n--I would take the position that the interpretation at first blush and upon further analysis is unreasonable.\\nDo you think the word bound is open to different interpretations as to what's bound?\\nYes.\\nAnd so is it open at all to the agency to decide that it includes these ring binders as being bound?\\nI mean, that would be one possible interpretation.\\nThat's one possible interpretation, and the question then becomes whether or not--\\nSo I would have thought, then, if you apply Chevron deference that's the end of the case for you.\\n--Well, their interpretation is predicated upon one provision, an explanatory note that isn't applicable at that level of the tariff schedule, which doesn't relate to whether or not things are bound.\\nIt relates to what things are made of.\\nThe schedule, this particular provision, this particular chapter, 4820, relates to paper, and what this explanatory note says, if things come with packaging that has metal, leather, et cetera, they will still be classified as paper that the other substance, the other material will not predominate.\\nEverything here in 4820 has to be held together in some fashion, because the chapter note says that these... this provision does not cover loose sheets, so everything has to be--\\nMr. Coll, there's one piece of this, before we get to the application of it, that I find vastly puzzling.\\nMaybe there's an easy answer to it.\\nYou talked about the provision that says, de novo review, but then you quickly said, and yes, there's a presumption of correctness.\\nThose two seem to be at loggerheads.\\nWhy are they not?\\nYou told me that the facts found by customs get a presumption of correctness.\\nOn the other hand, the facts are gone over de novo.\\n--It's a burden-of-proof issue, Your Honor.\\nIt's a matter that because there's a presumption of correctness, then the burden is slightly different on the plaintiff, the importer, than it might otherwise be, that he has a presumption that is working against him, and it's a burden of proof.\\nIt doesn't relate to deference.\\nBut focusing on chapter 4820 and why this is not appropriate interpretation and would be unreasonable even under Chevron, though we don't believe Chevron applies, the statute is fairly clear.\\nThe statute tells us that there are diaries, and there are similar articles, and then breaks it down further to diaries bound in all these other items that would be similar articles.\\nWell, but I had a little difficulty with your argument there.\\nIf you turn to pages 17 and 18 of your brief, on page 18 you make that argument.\\nYou say, in effect, diaries bound is to be contrasted with other, and one reason that you say that a diary does not fall... one reason that you say that this does not fall within the diary category is that it's not adapted for exhaustive recording of past events.\\nIt's a schedule.\\nBut in the statute itself, which you quote on the preceding page, on 17, there is the term in 4820.10.20, which you quote only with ellipsis, and that term refers to diaries.\\nIt also refers to notebooks and address books, bound, which does not seem to carry the same connotation.\\nThe notebooks and address books don't seem to carry any connotation one way or the other with respect to either recording past events or noting future schedules.\\nIf we don't engage in the ellipsis that you did and we refer to these other examples as having some bearing on what a diary is, your argument is considerably weaker, isn't it?\\nWell, I'm going to have to defer at this point in time to customs practitioners, who tell me that you cannot look in a classification as to this product at those other two, either by way of combination, because that isn't the way the law gets interpreted in combination products that exist elsewhere, so--\\nWell, but I assume that they're not intending to... you know, to exclude the interpretive rule, you know, noscitur a sociis.\\nWe sort of know each term by those associated with it, and if that interpretive canon applies, then there isn't a simple contrast between diaries and others.\\nThere's a contrast between diaries, notebooks, and address books and others, and notebooks and address books and others do not have the kind of connotation that you want us to read so clearly into diary.\\n--Well, I think that we have to start at the top, because that's what the chapter notes tell us.\\nThe chapter notes tell us... and the chapter notes are statutory, and the chapter notes tell us that we have to start at 4820.\\nWe can't start at 4820.10.20, or at 4810.40.\\nWe have to start at the top, and our argument is centered on the fact that it's diaries and similar articles.\\nI understand your point there perfectly well, but by the same token we can't ignore 48... 4820.10.20, either, and it seems to me that as the statute becomes progressively more detailed, it becomes progressively more indicative of what it may have in mind by similar articles, and it seems to me that by the ellipsis as you quote 4810.20 on page 18, you are in effect telling us to ignore whatever interpretive value there might be to considering notebooks and address books, and that does have some interpretive value, because notebooks and address books do not have a connotation of time past, time future, in the sense that your argument assumes.\\nBut we weren't classified as an address book, and we weren't classified as a notebook.\\nWe were classified as a bound diary, and the other two cannot support this classification.\\nThis classification was very simply made and very simply stated.\\nIt doesn't say--\\nSo your point is, we ignore them.\\n--We... yes.\\nIf the Court has no further questions--\\nI... ask you again about the statute that's quoted at page 3 of the Government's brief, which, as I understand it, indicates that if a proposed interpretive ruling modifies an earlier ruling, there has to be publication in the Customs Bulletin.\\n--Correct.\\nNow, that is inapplicable to the case before us?\\nRight.\\nThat was part of what they refer in the Customs Bar as the Mod Act.\\nIt was not in effect at the time that we were... this ruling came down.\\nThere's a second feature out there that relates to--\\nDo you think that this statute would be very important in another case, insofar as whether or not these rulings are... should be accorded Chevron deference because they're very much like a regulation, or do you think both cases, a case arising under this statute and your case, should be dealt with the same?\\n--I think it enhances part of their argument.\\nIt does not enhance their whole case, because I believe that it does not enhance the particular point, which is that these are conclusions of fact and law as to which one cannot dissect neatly those interpretive legal norms that would be required for Chevron deference.\\nBut in terms of process, in terms of notice, in terms of procedural regularity, it certainly is better than receiving a letter in the mail 2 years after you've gotten a classification ruling telling you that the classification ruling no longer is effective.\\nThank you, Mr. Coll.\\nActually, if you have an extra minute, if it's all right I'd like to go back for 1 second on the word determinations.\\nYes.\\nThe Government has also argued, and I wondered about this, I want to... that really we decided in Haggar that that word determinations must refer only to factual and not legal determinations.\\nI'd like to know your response to that.\\nAs I read the Haggar decision, there was an argument made at that time that Haggar, or the class... the regulation at issue in Haggar was not entitled to Chevron deference.\\nIt was not entitled to any deference because of de novo review.\\nWe have a legislative regulation there and as I understand the Court, the Court was trying to explain how those two elements, a statutory regulation that creates a legal norm, would... could still be harmonized with the de novo review feature, and used as an example there that could still be applied to the facts.\\nWe don't have that neat dissection.\\nOne can't surgically pull out the interpretive law from the fact in these types of classification rules.\\nThank you, Mr. Coll.\\nMr. Jones, you have 2 minutes remaining.\\nThank you.\\nI think I have two points.\\nJustice Breyer, as we understand the issue that you've been addressing, the Court expressly confronted and resolved it in the Haggar case.\\nThe Court quoted the same provision of the statute that you're quoting and said that the responsibility of the Court of International Trade to make its determinations on the record before it, meant that it was to assemble the record and make factual determinations and apply those facts to the law, but in... the Court said that deference can be given to the regulations without impairing the authority of the court to make factual determinations and to apply those determinations to the law de novo.\\nAnd what the Court said in Haggar was that the regulations, the interpretive regulations of the agency were part of the law that the Court of International Trade was to apply, which is our position precisely in this case.\\nI believe that... I want to say one more thing about this deliberative conclusion point.\\nNow, the cases that have described, that you look to the deliberative conclusion to find... in the interpretive ruling to decide whether to give deference to the agency's reasonable conclusions, involve rulings in particular.\\nIn Martin v. OSHRC, Occupational Safety & Health Review Commission, the Court applied the same principle of Chevron deference to an agency's citation when the citation had been issued in the... precisely in the format that Congress authorized for interpretive purposes, so I think you may need to look to the nature of the regulatory ruling... rulemaking program to decide, you know, what sort of specificity is required.\\nBut in the context of the customs service rulings, I think as a practical matter you're going to be looking at headquarters rulings that contain the deliberative analysis to find out what the agency's reasonable interpretation is.\\nThank you, Mr. Jones.\\nThe case is submitted.\",\n",

GOODWYN COMPANY, ING., an\\nAlabama Corporation, et al.\\n\\nEx parte Robert Willlam Huskey et al.\\nSC 1249.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nNovy. 6, 1975.\\n\\n\\nGuy F, Gunter III, Opelika, for petition-\\ners.\\n\\n\\nSamford, Denson & Horsley, Opelika,\\nfor W. B. Goodwyn Co., Inc., an Ala.Corp.,\\nopposed.\\n\\n\\nJONES, Justice.\\n\\nThis is a petition for a writ of manda-\\nmus from the Circuit Court of Lee County\\nto require Judge L. J.. Tyner to allow peti-\\ntioners Robert Huskey, Aubrey Huskey,\\nand Blanche Huskey to amend the com-\\nplaint they filed-against respondents W. B.\\nGoodwyn Company and Pawnee Construc-\\ntion Company.\\n\\nThe Huskeys filed their original com-\\nplaint on October 22, 1974, alleging dam-\\nages to their medical office building as a\\nresult of defendants’ trespass and negli-\\ngence in performing construction work.\\nAfter both respondents filed answers, a\\npre-trial conference was held and Judge\\nTyner entered a pre-trial order on March\\n26, 1975. Subsequently, on April 9, the peti-\\ntioners moved the Court for leave to\\namend their complaint. The amended com-\\nplaint added a claim for punitive damages,\\na claim for interference with the medical\\npractice of Aubrey Huskey, and a third\\ncause of action, alleging that a heart attack\\nsuffered by Blanche Huskey was a direct\\n\\nThe\\n\\nresult of the respondents’ activities.\\namount of damages sought was raised\\nfrom $12,000 for property damages to\\n$140,000 for the additional claims of puni-\\ntive damages, interference with medical\\npractice, and personal injuries.\\n\\nOn April 14, 1975, respondents moved\\nthe Court to strike the third cause of ac-\\ntion contained in the amended complaint or\\nin the alternative to continue that cause\\nuntil the next term of court. They moved\\nthe Court to strike the petitioners’ entire\\namended complaint on April 16, and Judge\\nTyner entered such an order. The Hus-\\nkeys then filed a petition for rule nisi and\\nwrit of mandamus in this Court. This\\nCourt entered an order on April 23 requir-\\ning Judge Tyner to show cause why he\\nshould not be required to vacate his order\\nsustaining the respondents’ motion to strike\\nand why he should not allow the petition-\\ners to amend. Judge Tyner answered the\\nshow cause order on may 23, forcing this\\nadjudication on the writ of mandamus.\\nWe grant the writ.\\n\\nHI This case presents two basic issues\\nfor review. First, is mandamus a proper\\nremedy to review an order striking amend-\\ned pleadings? Second, does the entry of\\na pre-trial order substantially foreclose\\nfurther amendments to the pleadings?\\n\\nOn the first issue, both petitioners and\\nrespondents base their arguments upon the\\ntwo recent Alabama cases, Ex parte Miller,\\n292 Ala. 554, 297 So.2d 802 (1974), and Ex\\nparte Stead, Jr, 294 Ala. 3, 310 So.2d 469\\n(1975). Both cases address the issue of\\nwhether mandamus is an appropriate rem-\\nedy for a party whose right to amend his\\ncomplaint has been denied by the trial\\njudge.\\n\\nIn the Miller case, the trial Judge had\\ndenied the petitioner’s attempt to add two\\nnew defendants by amendment, Justice\\nColeman reviewed previous Alabama law\\nto the effect that mandamus is only proper\\nwhere adequate relief cannot be had by ap-\\npeal, He observed that if the petitioner\\n\\n\\nee 5\\na\\n\\nwere denied relief through mandamus they\\nwould have to go through an entire trial\\nagainst the originally named defendants\\nbefore trying their case against the two\\nadditional defendants. Such a result, he\\nconcluded, rendered appeal inadequate in\\nthat case, Still, he cautioned that “[i]t is\\nnot to be assumed or understood . . .\\nthat mandamus will be allowed as a method\\nof reviewing all rulings denying the right\\nto amend a complaint or other pleading.”\\n\\nIn Stead, the issue of whether manda-\\nmus was a proper remedy to review the de-\\nnial of pleading amendments was addressed\\nby Justice Faulkner. In the Stead case,\\nthe plaintiff had moved to continue the\\ntrial several times during a two-year peri-\\nod between the first filing of the complaint\\nand the proposed amendment. The amend-\\nment changed the entire theory of the ac-\\ntion from a simple contract action to an\\naction encompassing fraud, misrepresenta-\\ntion, negligence, and wanton breach of\\ncontract, Pointing out the petitioner’s\\n“long history of delays and continuances,”\\nJustice Faulkner concluded that this was\\none of the cases in which mandamus\\nshould not be allowed to review the ruling\\ndenying the right to amend. The rationale\\nfor denying mandamus in the Stead case\\nwas to weigh the prejudice to the opposing\\nparty against the possibility that the peti-\\ntioner would have to go through a second\\ntrial. Where the trial on the issues would\\nbe unduly delayed or the opposing party\\nunduly prejudiced, the petition should be\\ndenied.\\n\\nApplying the Stead guidelines to the in-\\nstant case, we find that the petitioners do\\nnot have a long history of delays in this\\ntrial; they have asked for no continuances\\nand have offered no other amendments.\\nAlthough it added a new cause of action\\nfor Blanche Huskey’s heart attack, the\\namended complaint still arises from the\\nsame general fact situation involved in the\\noriginal complaint. With a continuance\\nfor medical depositions, the respondents\\ncan defend the amended complaint as easi-\\nly as the original claims for relief. The\\n\\ncontinuance will, of course, delay the trial,\\nbut the crux of the Stead test is whether\\nthe amendment will “unduly delay” the\\ntrial or “unduly prejudice” the respondents.\\n‘We hold that in the context of this case,\\nwhere the.bad faith elements of Stead are\\nabsent, the trial is not unduly delayed and\\nthe respondents are not unduly prejudiced\\nby the amended complaint; therefore,\\nmandamus is the proper remedy.\\n\\nHl Turning now to the second basic is-\\nsue of this case, we must decide what ef-\\nfect the entry of a pre-trial order should\\nhave upon the right to amend pleadings.\\nThis question is unresolved in Alabama\\npractice.\\n\\nThe practice in the federal system is not\\nstandardized. Many circuits adhere to the\\nstrict view that the pre-trial order should\\nnot be altered except to’ prevent manifest\\ninjustice. Idzojtic v. Pennsylvania R. Co.,\\n47 F.R.D. 25 (W.D.Pa.1969) ; Ely v. Read-\\ning Co., 424 F.2d 758 (3d Cir. 1970). Oth-\\ner circuits require that Rule 16 be read in\\nconjunction with Rules 1 and 15 to allow\\namendments when justice so requires.\\nWallin v. Fuller, 476 F.2d 1204 (Sth Cir.\\n1973); Bucky v. Sebo, 208 F.2d 304 (2d\\nCir, 1953); Dering v. Williams, 378 F.2d\\n417 (9th Cir. 1967).\\n\\nThe countervailing opinions of the fed-\\neral circuits dealing with this problem di-\\nverge from a common philosophical origin.\\nThey attempt to “balance the need for\\ndoing justice on the merits between the\\nparties (in spite of the errors and over-\\nsights of their attorneys) against the need\\nfor maintaining orderly and efficient pro-\\ncedural arrangements.” 3 Moore, Federal\\nPractice, § 16.20, at 1136 (1975).\\n\\nThe strict view of preserving the pre-\\ntrial order is grounded on a policy of expe-\\ndiency. To clear crowded dockets by ob-.\\ntaining admissions of fact and encouraging\\n\\n, settlement, to prevent surprise by revealing\\n\\nlists of witnesses and expected testimony,\\nto simplify the conduct of the trial by re-\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nfining issues and amending pleadings’ are\\namong the reasons advanced for strictly\\nadhering to pre-trial orders. Courts fol-\\nlowing this view hold that the trial court\\nhas a right to expect that at pre-trial pro-\\nceedings counsel will be as thoroughly fa-\\nmiliar with the case as they will be at trial.\\nMcCarthy v. Lerner Stores Corp., 9 F.R.D.\\n31 (D.D.C.1949). In those circuits, the\\npre-trial order will generally not be modi-\\nfied without a showing of manifest injus-\\ntice and the trial judge is given broad dis-\\ncretion to deny proposed amendments. Ely\\nv. Reading Co., supra.\\n\\nOn the other hand, circuits which permit\\nliberal amendment of pre-trial orders em-\\nphasize the need for doing justice between\\nthe parties over maintaining an orderly\\nprocedure. These circuits read Rule 16 in\\nconjunction with Rule 15 and “the mandate\\nof Rule 1 that rules shall be construed to\\nsecure a ‘just’ determination of every ac-\\ntion.” 6 Wright and Miller, Federal Prac-\\n\\ntice and Procedure, § 1491 at 456 (1971).\\n\\nIn the Sth Circuit case of Wallin v. Full-\\ner, supra, the court said, “Unbending ad-\\nherence to the strictures of Rule 16 would,\\nhowever, frustrate another broad policy of\\nthe federal rules favoring liberality of\\namendment, This policy is principally em-\\nbodied in Rule 15, which deals with amend-\\nments to the pleadings. It is unlikely that\\nthe pretrial order under Rule 16 was in-\\ntended to make the pleadings, and there-\\nfore Rule 15, obsolete.”\\n\\nIn choosing from these two views a\\ncourse of Alabama law, we draw upon\\nboth the textual additions to ARCP 15(b)\\nand the committee comments to ARCP 15\\nand 16 to discern the thinking of the draft-\\ners. The primary textual difference be-\\ntween the Alabama and the Federal Rules\\nregarding amended pleadings is the final\\ntwo sentences of Alabama’s Rule 15(b).\\nThey read, “An amendment shall not be\\nrefused under subdivision (a) and (b) of\\nthis rule solely because it adds a claim or\\n\\ndefense, changes a claim or defense, or\\nworks a complete change in parties. The\\nCourt is to be liberal in granting permis-\\nsion to amend when justice so requires.”\\n\\nIn his treatise on Alabama Practice,\\nChamp Lyons, the Committee Reporter, ad-\\nmits that “it could be persuasively argued\\nthat the rules dictated the result command-\\ned in the last two sentences of Rule 15(b)\\nwithout their inclusion. However, Com-\\nmittee sentiment was heavily on the side of\\nabundant clarity.” 1 Lyons, Alabama\\nPractice, § 15.5, at 308-9. ~In discussing\\nthe philosophy of Rule 15, Lyons says that\\nit is the sine qua non for the philosophy of\\nthe entire ARCP that “pleadings are a\\nmeans, not an end, and the action should\\nbe resolved on its merits, not upon techni-\\ncalitie. 2. Without [Rule 15\\'s]\\npermissive approach to the right to amend,\\nthe allegiance to substance over form\\nwhich permeates these rules would not be\\nattainable.” 1 Lyons, Alabama Practice, §\\n15.1, at 308. Such statements indicate that\\n\\n“in the balance between expedient disposi-\\n\\ntion of law suits and full justice on the\\nmerits, Alabama’s rules are weighted more\\nheavily in favor of the latter.\\n\\nTo apply Alabama’s policy of liberal\\namendments to the post pre-trial order sit-\\nuation, we refer to the Committee Com-\\nments to Rule 16 for guidance, The Com-\\nmittee seemed to be strongly opposed to\\nfollowing federai precedent in this area:\\n“[a]s the Rule approaches middle age in\\nthe Federal System, its abuse has returned\\nissue simplification to a level reminiscent\\nof the common law technicalities it was de-\\nsigned to replace . . this committee\\ncondemns the imposition of burdensome\\nand often wasteful requirements on pre-\\ntrial preparation.” Alabama Rules of\\nCourt, p. 66 (1975). Bearing this comment\\nin mind, we find it unlikely that the Com-\\nmittee anticipated the rigorous enforcement\\nof pre-trial orders practiced in those feder-\\nal courts which expect the counsel to be as\\n\\n\\nee\\na :\\n\\nthoroughly familiar with the case at pre-\\ntrial as they will be at trial.t\\n\\nWe believe that Alabama Rule 16 must\\nbe read in conjunction with Rule 15 and\\nRule 1; therefore, liberal allowance of\\namendment when justice so requires must\\ntake precedence over strict adherence to\\nthe pre-trial order in Alabama practice.\\nThe vast majority of federal courts adopt-\\ning this approach have faced the issue in\\nthe context of the trial or post-trial situa-\\ntion where amendments were offered to\\nconform the pleadings to the evidence un-\\nder Rule 15(b). It is important to note,\\nhowever, that appellants in the instant case\\nhave offered their amendments before the\\nbeginning of trial. Therefore, this case\\npresents an even stronger argument for al-\\nlowing amendments than the line of feder-\\nal cases we choose to follow. When’\\namendments are offered before trial, the\\nargument that the opposing party is preju-\\ndiced by unfair surprise vanishes, There is\\nstill time for discovery and preparation,\\nand a continuance to allow opponents to\\ncounter either new claims for relief or the-\\nories of defense is less time-consuming be-\\nfore trial begins than during its progress\\nor by post-trial procedure.\\n\\nOur analysis is not intended to\\nestablish absolute guidelines for allowing\\namendments following the entry of pre-\\ntrial orders, It is intended, rather, to ex-\\npouse the philosophy of the Alabama rules\\nin this area and explain how that philoso-\\nphy dictates certain results, Under Ala-\\nbama practice, the entry of a pre-trial or-\\nder does not supersede the Rule 15 require-\\nment that “amendments shall be freely al-\\nlowed when justice so requires.” To com-\\n\\n1. \"This is not to be understood as favoring a\\npolicy of treating the pre-trial conference and\\norder as relatively unimportant, To be sure,\\nRule 16 can be given a meaningful field of\\noperation only in the context of adequate\\npreparation commensurate with the highest\\nstandards of professionalism. We only em-\\nphasize that the pre-trial conference is not a\\ntrial on the merits, and it should not result\\n\\nply with Rule 15, the trial judge must al-\\n\\n‘low a proposed amendment if it is neces-\\n\\nsary for a full determination of the merits\\nof the case and it does not unduly preju-\\ndice the opposing party or unduly delay the\\ntrial?\\n\\nIn the context of the instant case, the\\nmerits cannot be fully litigated without al-\\nlowing the amendment because the amend-\\nment introduced additional claims for re-\\nlief. The only remaining issue is whether\\nthe amendment results in undue prejudice\\nor delay.\\n\\nPrimarily, the petitioners were trying to\\naccomplish three things by amendments.\\nFirst, they wanted to add an allegation of\\nmalicious conduct, thereby seeking punitive\\ndamages. Second, they wanted to include\\na claim for additional damages to Aubrey\\nHuskey’s medical practice. Third, they\\nwanted to introduce a new cause of action\\nby linking the respondents’ trespass to a\\nheart attack suffered by Blanche Huskey.\\n\\nThe first portion of the amendment\\nwould require no additional preparation on\\nthe part of the respondents. If they were\\nprepared to defend a charge of simple tres-\\npass for compensatory damages, they\\nshould be prepared to defend the punitive\\nallegation which will be more difficult for\\nthe petitioners to prove. ,\\n\\nOn the second addition, the respondents\\nwere already preparing to defend the claim\\nof damage to Aubrey Huskey’s medical\\npractice because they had requested and re-\\nceived all his tax returns for the years in\\nquestion.\\n\\nHM The final portion of the proposed\\namendment adding the cause of action for\\n\\nin an order so rigid as to preclude a full\\nadjudication of each case.\\n\\n2. This standard results from a combination\\nof our explication of Rules 15 and 16 and\\nthe test set out in the Stead case, which we\\nbelieve, of necessity, merged the considera-\\n\\ntions for the propriety of mandamus vis-\\nappeal with the guidelines for\\namendment to pleadings.\\n\\nallowing\\n\\n\\n8 —\\n\\nthe heart attack presents different consid-\\nerations because it requires medical testi-\\nmony and expert witnesses. To meet this\\nclaim, the respondents may justifiably re-\\nquest a continuance. As was previously\\ndiscussed, a continuance before the begin-\\nning of trial does not, in the usual case,\\nunduly delay the litigation, and should be\\ngranted whenever it is necessary to achieve\\na just determination on the merits.\\n\\nIn view of our holding that the trial\\nCourt erred in granting respondents’ mo-\\ntion to strike petitioners’ amended com-\\nplaint, we feel constrained to conclude on a\\nnote of caution. Nothing in this opinion is\\nto be construed as impinging on the exer-\\ncise of the trial court’s sound discretion in\\ndisallowing post pre-trial amendments in\\ninstances where the judicial process would\\nbe unduly delayed or impeded, or where\\nprejudice to the substantial rights of the\\nparties would result.\\n\\nWrit granted.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

This action was revived against his ad-\\nministratrix prior to trial.\\n\\nthe Utility’ Board of the City of Cullman\\n(The Cullman Power Board).\\n\\nThere are three issues for decision: (1)\\nDid Chambers offer a scintilla of evidence\\nupon which reasonable men could differ\\nwhich would support her cause of action\\nagainst either the Cullman Power Board or\\nBuettner? (2) Did the trial judge com-\\nmit prejudicial error in refusing to allow\\nChamber\\'s expert witness to testify as to\\nwhat sections of the National Electric\\nCode was violated by the defendant’s elec-\\ntrical system? (3) Did the trial judge\\nabuse his discretion in refusing to allow\\nChambers to recall a witness?\\n\\nOn Saturday, 15 July 1973, Terry Cham-\\nbers visited the apartment of Wallace Lo-\\ngan and James Holmes, tenants of Buett-\\nner. The apartment was located over\\nBuettner’s Paint and Hardware Store.\\nEmil Buettner was the owner and land-\\nlord. Terry Chambers and others who\\nwere at the apartment were listening to\\nmusic and drinking beer. Sometime during\\nthe evening Chambers fell asleep on a\\ncouch in the living room of the apartment.\\nDuring the early morning hours of Sunday\\na fire started in the building and spread to\\nthe apartment. When the fire was extin-\\nguished, Terry Chambers’ body was discov-\\nered under a bed in the apartment bed-\\nroom.\\n\\nIn an amended complaint, plaintiff al-\\nleged that Emil Buettner was under a duty\\nto rent the apartment in a reasonably safe\\ncondition for the protection of persons who\\nwere invited to come to the apartment. It\\nfurther alleged Buettner violated this duty\\nby negligently renting the premises in an\\nunsafe or defective condition. The com-\\nplaint also alleged the Cullman Power\\nBoard violated a duty to members of the\\npublic who would rightfully be upon the\\n\\n2. A third defendant, Cecil Langley, the elec-\\ntrician who installed the system at Buettner’s\\nStore, was dismissed as a party defendant\\nupon motion by plaintiff.\\n\\n\\nil\\n\\nproperty by negligently furnishing electri-\\ncal power service to the apartment when\\nthe apartment electrical system was unfit\\nto receive such service.\\n\\nThe tendencies of the evidence showed:\\nthe fire originated in an electrical conduit\\nwhich ran from meter boxes on the outside\\nof the building to a fuse panel box in the\\nupstairs hallway of the building; that box\\nserved a meeting hall which Buettner rent-\\ned to a labor union; precise point of ori-\\ngin of the fire was in the conduit several\\ninches below the fuse box; the insulation\\non the wires inside the conduit box broke\\ndown; this caused electricity to arc from\\nthe wire to the conduit; the intense heat\\ngenerated by this arcing melted a hole in\\nthe conduit and caused the plywood wall\\nbehind the conduit to ignite.3 There was\\nsome evidence that the outside meter box-\\nes, the conduit, and the fuse panel box\\nwere improperly grounded. Such an im-\\nproper grounding would allow arcing to\\ncontinue instead of overloading the circuit\\nand blow the fuses to shut off electrical\\npower.\\n\\nFurther tendencies of the evidence were:\\nthe meter box on the outside of the build-\\ning in which the apartment was located\\nwas improperly grounded; the supplier of\\nelectricity (Cullman Power Board) con-\\nnects service at this box; visual inspection\\nof the outside meter box and the electrical\\nconduits originating from that box and en-\\ntering the building should have indicated to\\nthe serviceman that the system as a whole\\nwas defective, therefore Chambers asserts\\nthat the Cullman Power Board knew or\\nshould have known that the system was de-\\nfective, and power should not have been\\nsupplied to the building.\\n\\nThe Directed Verdict For The Cullman\\nPower Board\\n\\n[I Chambers claims the Power Board\\ncommitted actionable negligence in supply-\\n\\n3. Buettner and the Power Board attempted\\nto elicit testimony that the fire originated\\nin the apartment.\\n\\nHowever no evidence was\\n\\ning electricity to a defective electrical sys-\\ntem. The duty of a supplier of electricity\\nto premises wholly owned and controlled\\nby the recipient of -service is well settled.\\nA supplier who merely furnishes electricity\\nis not responsible for defects in the system\\nto which electricity is supplied. It is under\\nno duty to inspect the system to which\\nelectricity is supplied’ The duty of the\\nsupplier ends when the connection is prop-\\nerly made, when the supplier has no con-\\ntrol over the premises, and the supplier is\\nwithout actual knowledge of any defective\\nor dangerous condition.

There was no proof in\\nthis case either that Buettner had agreed\\nto make any needed repairs to the prem-\\nises, a part of which were rented to Cham-\\nbers’ hosts on the fateful occasion, or that\\nBuettner knew of and concealed any latent\\ndefect in the premises relating to the elec-\\ntrical system,\\n\\nChambers claims Buettner’s liability can\\nbe properly bottomed on the rule of law\\nwith respect to injury to strangers caused\\nby a defect in rented premises as expressed\\nin Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v.\\nTraylor, 239 Ala. 497, 195 So. 724 (1940).\\nThe instant case clearly is within the ambit\\nof the rule of liability of landlord to tenant\\nand his privies rather than the rule of lia-\\nbility of landlord to strangers.\\n\\nChambers further asserts that she was\\n\\nentitled to have her case submitted to the\\njury on the theory that the offending con-\\n\\nduit ran to a panel box which served a un-\\nion hall in the premises; that the conduit\\nand panel box therefore were not part of\\nthe premises rented to Logan and Holmes\\n(tenants of Buettner and invitors of dece-\\ndent Chambers) hence in the exercise of\\nreasonable care Buettner could and should\\nhave discovered the defect or insufficiency\\nin the grounding of the conduit and owed\\na duty to decedent Chambers to correct\\nany defect or insufficiency.\\n\\nTI This theory must fail even if we\\nassume, arguendo, that any defect or insuf-\\nficiency present was “a dangerous condi-\\ntion” such as would invoke the rule set out\\nin Pearce v. Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron\\nCo., 211 Ala. 639, 101 So. 585 (1924). The\\ntule as established in that case is also em-\\nbodied in Restatement (Second) of Torts,\\n§ 361 (1965):\\n\\n“A possessor of land who leases a part\\nthereof and retains in his control any\\nother part which is necessary to the safe\\nuse of the leased part, is subject to lia-\\nbility to his lessee and others lawfully\\nupon the land with the consent of the\\nlessee or a sublessee for physical harm\\ncaused by a dangerous condition upon\\nthat part of the land retained in the les-\\nsor’s control, if the lessor by the exercise\\nof reasonable care\\n\\n(a) could have discovered the condi-\\ntion and the risk involved, and\\n\\n(b) could have made the condition\\nsafe.”\\n\\nThe two principal reasons the theory ad-\\nvanced by Chambers, last referred to, will\\nnot operate under the rule set out in the\\nRestatement to permit a jury to pass on\\nthe liability of Buettner to Chambers are:\\n(A) There was no evidence that Buettner\\nretained control over that portion of the\\npremises where the conduit was located\\nthat may have been insufficiently ground-\\ned. (B) There was no evidence that\\nBuettner could have discovered the condi-\\ntion and the risk involved. As to B some\\nevidence would be necessary which showed\\nat least a rudimentary knowledge on the\\n\\n\\npart of Buettner of proper methods of\\nelectrical wiring systems, grounding etc. so\\nthat any discoverable condition that existed\\nwould have alerted him to a risk of physi-\\ncal harm to anyone lawfully on the prem-\\nises.\\n\\nHl As is well known, a motion for a\\ndirected verdict at the close of the plain-\\ntiff’s case tests the sufficiency of the\\nplaintiffs evidence to entitle the claim for\\nrelief to be submitted to the jury for deci-\\nsion.\\n\\n“« * * Tf a trial judge decides\\nthere is not a scintilla of evidence upon\\nwhich the jury could reasonably reach a\\nverdict * * * he can direct the ver-\\ndict without submitting the credibility of\\nthe witnesses to the jury if their testimo-\\nny is uncontradicted and unimpeached.\\n* * *” Alabama Power Co. v. Tay-\\nlor, 293 Ala. 484, 306 So.2d 236 (1975).\\n\\nThe trial and appellate courts must view\\nthe evidence in the most favorable light to\\nthe party against whom the motion was\\n\\nmade. Alabama Power Co. v. Taylor, su-*\\n\\npra; 5A Moore’s Federal Practice, {[ 50.-\\n02[1], at 2325 (1975); in this case in the\\nmost favorable light to Chambers. Thus\\nviewed the evidence was not sufficient to\\namount to a scintilla upon which the jury\\ncould reasonably reach a verdict against ei-\\nther the Power Board or Buettner.\\n\\nExpert Opinion As To Violations\\nOf Electrical Code\\n\\nHM During trial Chambers asked an\\nexpert witness the following question:\\n\\n“Now, with reference to the grounding\\nsystem and the connection as it existed\\n\\nas you saw it on September the Ist, and\\nI think you said it appeared to have been\\nin the same condition for a long time,\\ndoes that system violate any specific\\nparagraphs or sections of the National\\nElectrical Code?”\\n\\nObjection to this question was properly\\nsustained, Alabama Power Co. v. Wil-\\nliams, 222 Ala. 75, 130 So. 788 (1930); 7\\nWigmore on Evidence, § 1958, at 85-86\\n(1940).\\n\\nDiscretion Of The Trial Court\\n\\nHl Chambers attempted to recall Cecil\\nLangley, the electrician who installed the\\nelectrical system in Buettner’s store. The\\nCullman Power Board objected.\\n\\n“THE COURT: I am going to sus-\\ntain any questions to him, it is in rebut-\\ntal, I am assuming, you have nothing to\\nrebutt (sic) at this time.”\\n\\nChambers made no offer of proof as to\\nwhat he intended to show by recalling\\nLangley nor did he attempt to disabuse the\\ncourt of the assumption that the witness\\nwould be used merely in rebuttal. Both\\nparties recognize that the right to recall a\\nwitness rests within the discretion of the\\ntrial court. The trial court did not abuse\\nthat discretion in this case.\\n\\nThere were no errors in the trial of this\\naction which require reversal.\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\nBLOODWORTH, MADDOX, FAULK-\\nNER and ALMON, JJ., concur,\\n\\n\\n14 |\\n\\n321 So.2d 655\\n\\nIn re the MEAD CORPORATION\\n\\nve\\nCITY OF BIRMINGHAM, Alabama, et al.\\nEx parte CITY OF BIRMINGHAM,\\na Municipal Corporation.\\nSC 1211.\\nSupreme Court of Alabama,\\n\\nOct. 2, 1975.\\n\\nRehearing Denied Nov. 26, 1975.\\n\\nNorman K.

We\\ngrant the writ.\\n\\nOn February 4, 1975, the City Council of\\nBirmingham adopted a resolution of an-\\nnexation of certain territory located out-\\nside the city limits. An election was or-\\ndered to be held on March 8, by the Pro-\\nbate Judge. Meanwhile, on February 17,\\nMead Corporation filed a complaint in the\\nBessemer Division of the Circuit Court\\nchallenging the legality of the election, and\\nseeking a temporary restraining order, and\\na preliminary injunction. Judge Pickens\\nissued a temporary restraining order.\\nSubsequently Birmingham filed a motion to\\ntransfer the case to the Birmingham Divi-\\nsion, alleging that the cause of action did\\nnot accrue or arise in the Bessemer Divi-\\nsion, and therefore that division did not\\nhave jurisdiction. Judge Pickens overruled\\nthe motion. On appeal to this court, we\\nsuspended the temporary injunction that\\nhad held up the election. The election was\\nheld, as scheduled, and a majority of the\\nqualified electors voted in favor of annex-\\nation. In accordance with our order, the\\nresults were’ not certified to the Judge of\\nProbate.\\n\\nAfter the election, Birmingham peti-\\ntioned this court for a writ of mandamus,\\nasking that Judge Pickens’ order denying\\nthe motion to transfer, be set aside. We\\nissued a rule nisi requiring the Judge to\\nshow cause why his order should not be set\\naside, and the case transferred to the Bir-\\nmingham Division, Judge Pickens answer-\\n\\ned that the territory sought to be annexed\\nwas within the Bessemer Division; conse-\\nquently, the action was properly brought\\nthere. On the other hand, Birmingham as-\\nserts that the action was improperly\\nbrought in the Bessemer Division because\\nthe cause of action did not accrue or arise\\nwithin the territorial limits of that division\\nand that the Bessemer Division has exclu-\\nsive jurisdiction only over causes of action\\narising within it.\\n\\nIn Ex parte Central of Georgia Ry. Co.,\\n243 Ala. 508, 10 So.2d 746 (1942) this\\ncourt said, “. the court at Besse-\\nmer has exclusive jurisdiction of all civil\\nactions at law upon causes of action aris-\\ning in the territorial jurisdiction of that\\ncourt, and such jurisdiction is limited to\\nsuits upon causes of action arising within\\nsuch territory.” In Ex parte Southern\\nBuilding Code Congress, 282 Ala. 523, 213\\nSo.2d 365 (1968) this court re-emphasized\\nthat the venue approach had been aban-\\ndoned, and adopted as a basis of jurisdic-\\ntion in the Bessemer Division, the fact as\\nto where the cause of action, or case, ac-\\ncrued or arose.\\n\\nIn this case we are of the opinion that\\nthe cause of action accrued or arose in the\\nBirmingham Division. The subject matter\\nof the suit does not involve title to land.\\nOn the contrary, the subject matter is an\\nelection having its situs in Birmingham.\\nThe Probate Judge ordered the election\\nheld in Birmingham, the ballots were can-\\nvassed in Birmingham, and the results\\nwere made known there. Thus, all of the\\nfacts giving rise to the suit occurred in\\nBirmingham. The suit, therefore, should\\nbe heard in Birmingham, and the trial\\njudge erred when he denied the motion to\\ntransfer.\\n\\nThe writ of mandamus is due to be\\nawarded.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C. J., and MERRILL,\\nBLOODWORTH, MADDOX, ALMON\\nand EMBRY, JJ., concur.\\n\\n\\n16\\nSHORES, J., concurs in the result.\\nJONES, J., dissents.\\n\\nJONES, Justice (dissenting) :\\n\\nI disagree with the result and the ration-\\nale of the majority. The question present-\\ned by this Petition for Mandamus is con~\\ntrolled by the Bessemer Court Act of 1919\\n(Local Acts of 1919, p. 62), §§ 2 and 914,\\nwhich provides in pertinent part that all\\nequity cases arising in the Bessemer Cut-\\nOff may be brought either in Bessemer or\\nBirmingham, and that no case at law or in\\nequity is to be brought in Bessemer unless\\nthe case arose in the Bessemer Cut-Off.\\nEx parte Central of Georgia Ry. Co., 243\\nAla. 508, 10 So.2d 746 (1942). All of the\\nterritory sought to be annexed through the\\nannexation election is situated in the Bes-\\nsemer Cut-Off, and all of the people af-\\nfected thereby live in the Bessemer Cut-\\nOff. To hold—as the majority does—that,\\nsince the election was scheduled by the\\nProbate Court to be held in Birmingham,\\nthe cause of action arose in Birmingham\\nand not in the Bessemer Cut-Off is an ad-\\njudication of one of the principal issues\\nraised in the complaint filed by Mead Cor-\\nporation challenging the legality of the\\nelection.\\n\\nThe opinion states as a fact that “the\\nsubject matter is an election having its si-\\ntus in Birmingham. The Probate ‘Judge\\nordered the election held in Birmingham,\\nthe ballots were canvassed in Birmingham,\\nand the results were made known there.”\\n\\nIt seems to me that the entire factual ba-\\nsis for concluding that the cause of action\\n(Mead’s complaint contesting the election)\\ndid not arise in the Bessemer Cut-Off has\\nbeen adjudicated adversely to Mead for the\\nfirst time in this cause on appeal. The\\nonly issue properly before this Court is\\n\\n- whether Mead’s election contest suit is an\\naction which accrued in the Bessemer\\nCut-Off and thus was properly filed there.\\n\\nFor this Court to adjudicate the merits\\nof Mead’s claim of contest can only have\\n\\nthe effect of cutting the pattern to fit the\\ncloth, By prejudging the merits of Mead’s\\nmain action, the Court has found a factual\\nbasis for concluding that the cause of ac-\\ntion accrued outside the territorial limits of\\nthe Bessemer Cut-Off. The fact that the\\nelection has already been held in Birming-\\nham, in support of the conclusion that the\\ncause of action accrued in Birmingham,\\nconstitutes some sort of reverse rationale\\nto which I am judicially unaccustomed.\\n\\nI have made no prejudgment as to the\\nmerits of Mead’s contentions for contesting\\nthe election; but I have no difficulty in\\nconcluding that the legislative acts creating\\nthe Bessemer Cut-Off permit a suit to be\\nfiled and maintained in Bessemer which\\nhas as its gravamen the contest of an an-\\nnexation election affecting solely the terri-\\ntory and people within the geographical\\nconfines of the Bessemer Cut-Off.\\n\\n321 So.2d 657\\nPhillip HOOMES et al.\\nVv.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL HARVESTER COM-\\nPANY, a corporation.\\n\\nSC 1222.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nNoy, 18, 1975.\\n\\n\\na!\\n\\nJohn L.

Defendant moved for a summary\\njudgment on March 8 and it was granted\\non April 5, Plaintiff moved to amend by\\njoining Carey Hoomes as a party plaintiff,\\nand the amendment was allowed. On Sep-\\ntember 5, 1974, defendant moved for a dis-\\nmissal of plaintiffs’ breach of warranty\\nclaim. Plaintiffs dismissed the action on\\nNovember 11 and plaintiffs’ counsel with-\\ndrew from the case on January 27, 1975.\\nPresent counsel was given permission to\\nrefile and the second Count Four was re-\\nfiled on February 13. Defendant again\\nmoved for summary judgment. The mo-\\ntion was heard on February 24, 1975.\\n\\nThe only evidence was the deposition of\\nthe plaintiff, Phillip Hoomes. He was an\\nexperienced truck driver and had been\\ndriving trucks for some nine years when\\nhe purchased the truck in question at de-\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nfendant’s place of business in Dothan. He\\narrived in Dothan at 8:00 A.M. on March\\n16, 1974. He talked with defendant’s\\nsalesman, E. S. Patton. His testimony was\\nthat Patton represented to him that the ve-\\nhicle was new and that the 1900 miles on\\nthe speedometer constituted the mileage\\nfrom having been driveri from the manu-\\nfacturer’s place of business in Fort Wayne,\\nIndiana to Dothan, and one demonstration\\nride into the State of Georgia and back.\\nHoomes inspected the truck. He found that\\nthe truck had a different number of miles\\non it than would have normally corre-\\nsponded with the hours shown on the ta-\\nchometer; and that the tachometer actually\\nshowed 236 or 237 hours, that the speed-\\nometer showed 1900 miles. He asked that\\nthey set the number of hours back on the\\ntachometer, which they did at his request.\\nHe noticed that the truck had a dead bat-\\ntery, a skinned place on the fender and\\n“stuff like that.” The seller replaced U-\\nbolts that he had requested. He also ob-\\nserved that the truck had a broken wind-\\nshield. After all of his inspections, he\\nthen road-tested the truck himself and dis-\\ncovered that the oil pressure gauge on it\\ndid not work, and requested it be changed,\\nand it was replaced. He left with the\\ntruck about 5:00 P.M. At one stage of his\\ntestimony, the following appears:\\n\\n“A. Phillip, with nineteen hundred\\n(1900) miles on it you knew that\\nthis was not a new truck when-you\\npurchased it, didn’t you?\\n\\n“A, Well, Yeah, in a way and in a way\\nnot because I asked them about\\nthat and they said that is the mile-\\nage from Fort Wayne, Indiana,\\nwhere the truck was manufactured,\\nto Dothan, Alabama, and one dem-\\nonstrator to Georgia and back.”\\n\\nHoomes drove the truck some 30,000 miles\\nbefore filing the suit. His deposition also\\n\\nshowed that the tachometer, which had\\nbeen set back, was’ not the original tachom-\\neter that had been on the truck. The orig-\\ninal had been replaced by defendant.\\n\\nPart of.the trial court’s decree reads:\\n\\n“*« * * Tt is further ORDERED and\\nADJUDGED, that the motion for summa-\\nry judgment as to the Second Count\\nFour sounding in the theory of recovery\\non the basis of fraud or deceit or misrep-\\nresentation be and is hereby granted,\\nbased on the deposition of the plaintiff\\nand the acknowledgement of the plaintiff\\ntherein that he knew that the truck was\\nnot ‘a new truck’ at the time it was pur-\\nchased.”\\n\\nIt must be conceded that the tendencies\\nof the evidence support the finding of the\\ntrial court; but the evidence that plaintiff\\n“knew that the truck was not ‘a new truck’\\nat the time it was purchased” was not\\nwholly uncontested. It can be seen that,\\nthe quoted part of Phillip Hoomes’ deposi-\\ntion was equivocal, and his deposition did\\ncast some doubt on the verity of the repre-\\nsentations that he contended were made to\\nhim that the truck had only been driven\\nfrom the manufacturing plant in Indiana\\nto Dothan and on a demonstration trip into\\nGeorgia.\\n\\nThe deposition of Hoomes, taken in its\\nentirety, does, raise, in our opinion, a suffi-\\ncient genuine issue of fact for trial as re-\\nquired by ARCP 56(e), and there is no ev-\\nidence by way of any counter affidavit on\\nthe part of the defendant. The plaintiffs’\\nevidence, though slight, was sufficient to\\navert a summary judgment at this stage of\\nthe proceedings.\\n\\nReversed and remanded,\\n\\nHEFLIN, C, J., and MADDOX, JONES\\nand SHORES, JJ., concur.\\n\\n\\nbe 19\\nas\\n\\n321 So.2d 659\\nJoseph RUDOLPH\\nve\\nMary BRADLEY et al.\\nSC 1251.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nNov. 6, 1975.\\n\\nTipler, Fuller & Barnes, Andalusia, for\\nappellees.\\n\\nJONES, Justice.\\n\\nIs the trial Court’s finding, and decree\\nrendered thereon, that Mary Bradley is an\\nheir of Andrew Lee Rudolph, and thus\\nowns a one-half undivided interest in cer-\\ntain property, supported by competent evi-\\ndence?

Annie had four daughters—\\nBrunetta, Daisy, Annie Lee, and Mary.\\nThe three oldest children were admittedly\\nborn before Annie and Andrew married.\\nAnnie Lee, the youngest of the three, was\\nborn in 1930.\\n\\nThe factual controversy centers around\\nthe date of birth of the youngest child,\\nMary. The case was tried before the\\nCourt without a jury. The oral testimony\\nis in sharp conflict and the documentary\\nevidence is not conclusive. There was evi-\\ndence, however, tending to prove that\\nMary was born in 1933 and that the\\nyoungest of Annie’s four children was not\\nborn until after Andrew came to live at\\n“Uncle Amos’s”, the home where Annie\\nwas living at the time of her marriage to\\nAndrew on January 3, 1933.\\n\\nMoreover, there is ample evidence,\\nthough contradicted, to support the finding\\nof legitimacy on the basis of Andrew\\'s rec-\\ncognition of Mary as his daughter following\\nhis marriage to Annie, Tit. 27, § 10, Code.\\n\\nOur scope of review under the ore tenus\\nrule is too well settled to bear repetition or\\nelaboration, See Sterling Oil of Okla-\\nhoma, Inc. v.

The amendment reads:\\n\\n“Beginning in the year 1976 regular\\nsessions of the Legislature shall be held\\nannually on the first Tuesday in May, or\\non such other day as may be prescribed\\nby law, and shall be limited to 30 legisla-\\ntive days and 105 calendar days.

We an-\\nswer your second question in the affirma-\\ntive. ~\\n\\nHM We have examined the legislative\\nproceedings relating to the passage of this\\nbill, Two amendments show, in our opin-\\nion, that the intent of the Legislature was\\nto specifically exempt regular sessions\\nfrom the operation of the amendment until\\n1976.\\n\\nAct No, 2 originated as a bill in the Sen-\\nate, was amended in the House of Repre-\\nsentatives by changing the number of days\\nand changing the date of submission to the\\nvoters. The bill was sent to a Conference\\nCommittee and as amended in the Confer-\\nence Committee report, it was passed by\\nboth Senate and House. An amendment\\nby the House and a Conference Commitiée\\namendment show that the Legislature did\\nnot want the amendment to apply to the\\nregular session of 1975, They intended for\\nthe people to vote on the amendment while\\nthe Legislature was in regular session, but\\nthey did not want the new amendment to\\ngovern that regular session. So, for the\\nfirst time, the words “Beginning in the\\nyear 1976” were added at the beginning of\\nthe amendment.\\n\\nThe amendment deals with two subjects,\\nregular and special sessions, A separate\\nsentence is devoted to each subject. It is\\nclear that the provisions as to regular ses-\\nsions could not apply in 1975. But no\\nform of punctuation or wording of any\\nsort is used in the sentence relating to spe-\\ncial sessions.\\n\\n\\n22 |\\n\\nHI We, therefore, opine that the\\namendment applies to any special session\\nof the Legislature which came into being\\nafter the amendment was proclaimed to\\nhave been ratified as this one was prior to\\nthe calling of this present Third Extra\\nSession of the Legislature.\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nHOWELL HEFLIN\\nChief Justice\\n\\nPELHAM J.

The ap-\\npellees sought free access across said strip\\nof land to Bon Secour River for them-\\nselves and other members of the public by\\nreason of certain reservations made in\\ndeeds of conveyance prior to and including\\nthe deed of conveyance whereby the appel-\\nlant obtained title to Lot 8\\n\\nThe original owner, Emmet Wenzel,\\nconveyed to Jean A. Hopkins, in May of\\n\\n23\\n\\n1949, the lot in controversy, Lot 8, with the\\nfollowing exception: “A strip of land 20\\nfeet wide on the south side of said Lot (8)\\nsaid strip of land to be used for street pur-\\nposes only, and to extend from the South-\\neast Corner of said Lot West to the wa-\\nter.” In November of 1952 the original\\nowner, Emmett Wenzel, conveyed to Bald-\\nwin County the following:\\n\\n“the North Ten (10) feet of Lot Seven\\n(7) and the South Twenty (20) feet of\\nLot Eight (8) . .+ The purpose of\\nthis conveyance is to provide a public\\nway to and from Bon Secour River for\\nthe owners of the land to the East of\\nthis subdivision and for the general pub-\\nlic.”\\n\\n.

The court directed the appellants\\nto remove the chain-link fence “across or\\non the south twenty (20) feet of said Lot\\n8” and enjoined them from “in any way or\\nmanner obstructing the free and unimpeded\\nuse of the south twenty (20) feet of said\\nLot 8 by the public and, in particular, the\\nowners of the land to the East of this Sub-\\ndivision, as a means of access and way to\\nand from Bon Secour River.”\\n\\nThe appellants’ motion for a new trial\\nwas denied,\\n\\nHM Appellant contends that the trial\\ncourt’s findings and judgment are contrary\\nto the evidence and erroneous.\\n\\n“A decree of the trial court will not be\\nreversed in a suit to establish a boundary\\nline unless it is palpably wrong and con-\\ntrary to the great weight of the evi-\\n\\n“dence.” Varner v. Carr, 291 Ala. 654,\\n656, 286 So.2d 294, 295 (1973).\\n\\nThe trial judge made a view of the land\\nin controversy and made the following\\nstatement:\\n\\n“T went and looked at this and it\\nlooked to me there is no doubt they\\ncurved this strip and run the people into\\na slough; it certainly doesn’t go to Bon\\nSecour River. My ruling is: That they\\nare entitled to 20 feet all of the way to\\nBon Secour River.”\\n\\nWe have studied the briefs very careful-\\nly, and we have made a diligent search of\\nthe record. We are not persuaded that the\\nfindings and decree of the trial judge are\\npalpably wrong and contrary to the great\\nweight of the evidence.\\n\\nHI Appellants next contend that the\\ntrial court erred in failing to admit testi-\\nmony concerning Lot 7, on the south side\\nof the lot in controversy, which evidence\\nshowed an enclosure of a part of the\\nright-of-way. They argue that the admis-\\nsion of testimony concerning Lot 7 would\\nhave shown the unsuitability of the disput-\\ned strip of land as a roadway beyond Old\\nBon Secour Run and, therefore, that the\\noriginal owner did not intend to dedicate\\nthe entire disputed strip.\\n\\nThis court stated in Webb v. Demopolis,\\n95 Ala, 116, 131, 13 So, 289, 294 (1892),\\nand repeated in Stack v. Tennessee Land\\nCompany, 209 Ala. 449, 452, 96 So. 355,\\n358 (1923), that\\n\\n“.,, [A] dedication of land as a\\nstreet can in no case, in our opinion, be\\ndefeated by considerations going to the\\nrelative adaptability of the land to that\\nend, or to difficulties of subjecting it to\\nsuch uses in point of fact, or to the ex-\\ntent of the use to which it will be sub-\\njected when its natural obstructions have\\nbeen removed, or even to the necessity to\\n\\nso use it all.”\\n\\nFinding no error to reverse, the judg-\\nment appealed from is affirmed.\\n\\nAffirmed,\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Hubbard, and Charles L.\\nParks, Anniston, for appellant.\\n\\n\\nEE 29\\na\\n\\nJ. M. Sides, Anniston, for appellees.\\n\\nJONES, Justice.\\n\\nThis is an appeal from a directed verdict\\nin favor of Anniston Lincoln Mercury,\\nInc., and its agent, Clarence Alfred Rob-\\nerts, Jr. in a wrongful death action\\nbrought against them by Grace Leeth, as\\nAdministratrix of the estate of O. J. Leth.\\n\\nThere are two issues for review: First,\\ndoes evidence that the defendants’ automo-\\nbile came to a stop one to two feet across\\nthe center line following a head-on colli-\\nsion on a two-lane road make out a jury\\nquestion on the issue of negligence? Sec-\\nond, must testimony concerning the posi-\\n\\ntion of vehicles after a collision be corrob-\\norated by proof that the vehicles had not\\nbeen moved between the time of the acci-\\ndent and the time of the observation by a\\nwitness in order to be admissible?\\n\\nWe answer both questions in favor of\\nthe appellant; therefore, we reverse and\\nremand for a new trial.\\n\\nBecause this case must be retried on re-\\nmand, we consider it unwise to discuss the\\nevidence extensively. Suffice it to say\\nthat the left front end of the car driven by\\nplaintiff\\'s intestate collided with the left\\nfront end of the car driven by Roberts in a\\ncurve on Highway 9 near Lineville, Ala~\\nbama, on January 25, 1973. Plaintiff\\'s in-\\ntestate died instantly as a result of the col-\\nlision. Appellant brought this wrongful\\ndeath action urging the theory that Roberts\\nwas hugging the inside of the curve in vio-\\nJation of the rules of the road.\\n\\nOn direct examination, the plaintiff\\ncalled Roberts who testified that he saw\\nthe Leeth car coming toward him and he\\nbegan to pull his car to the right when the\\ncollision occurred. He also testified that\\nimmediately after the head-on collision the\\nfront end of his car came to rest one or\\ntwo feet across the center line of the high-\\nway, i.e, to his left of the center line.\\nHe then drove his car across the road and.\\nparked his car off the paved surface onto\\nthe shoulder of the highway.\\n\\nAt the close of the plaintiff’s case, the\\ntrial Judge granted the defendant’s motion\\nfor a directed verdict.\\n\\nTI The propriety of this ruling is em-\\nbraced in the issue whether Roberts’ testi-\\nmony that he was pulling right immediate-\\nly before the collision and that his car\\ncame to rest across the center line after\\nthe collision makes out a jury question on\\nnegligence. The Alabama case of Smith v.\\nTripp, 246 Ala. 421, 20 So.2d 870 (1945), is\\ndirectly on point, In that case, the only\\ncompetent evidence on the issue of liability\\nshowed “that the driver of the defendants’\\ntruck pulled to the right immediately be-\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\nfore the collision” and that his truck came\\nto rest with the back corner of the trailer\\nslightly over the center line. The Court\\nheld that this testimony was enough to\\nmake out a jury question (and, indeed, to\\nsustain a jury verdict) on whether the de-\\nfendants’ truck was hugging the inside of\\nthe curve immediately before the collision.\\nWe hold that Tripp is authority for this\\nsituation; therefore, it was error to grant\\na directed verdict for the defendant.\\n\\nTHM Because the evidentiary question\\nwill likely arise again upon retrial of this\\ncause, we will now treat that issue,\\n\\nPlaintiff called Wayne Watts as a wit-\\nness. Watts had followed the police to the\\naccident scene, The plaintiff asked Watts\\nwhere the vehicles were located at the\\nscene of the accident. The trial Judge ex-\\ncluded this testimony because the plaintiff\\ncould not prove that the automobiles had\\nnot been moved between the time of the\\ncollision and the time Watts arrived on the\\nscene. Both parties rely upon the cases of\\nHolley v. Josey, 263 Ala. 349, 82 So.2d 328\\n(1955), and Malone v. Hanna, 275 Ala.\\n534, 156 So.2d 626 (1963), to support their\\npositions on this appeal.\\n\\nThe Josey case, which was quoted at\\nlength and approved in the Hanna case, af-\\nfirmed the trial Court’s admission of evi-\\ndence concerning the location of objects\\nfound at the scene of an automobile acci-\\ndent even though the proponents could not\\nprove that the objects were in the same\\nplace when the witnesses saw them as they\\nwere at the time of the accident. The Jos-\\ney Court cited and distinguished three Ala-\\nbama cases: S. H. Kress & Co. v. Barratt,\\n226 Ala. 455, 147 So. 386 (1933); Bradley\\nv. Deaton, 208 Ala. 582, 94 So. 767 (1922) ;\\nSouthern Railway Co. v. Lefan, 195 Ala.\\n295, 70 So. 249 (1915). See also Birming-\\n\\n1. Fer a good discussion of “Prior or Subse-\\nquent Existence,” see Il Wigmore on Evi-\\n\\ndence, § 487, p. 413 (1940).\\n\\n2. This is not to be understood as changing or\\notherwise affecting those cases which recog-\\n\\nham Union Railway Co. v. Alexander, 93\\nAla. 133, 9 So. 525 (1890).\\n\\nThe Josey court stated that the cited cas-\\nes held “in substance, that if a party, in an\\neffort to show negligence, attempts to in-\\ntroduée evidence as to conditions before or\\nafter the time of the accident, it must be\\nfirst made to appear that the conditions\\nwere substantially the same on the two oc-\\ncasions”; but it held that “the rule as ex-\\npressed by these cases is limited to where\\nit is an attempt to show negligence”.\\n\\nThe appellees argue that this language\\njustifies the trial Judge’s exclusion of\\nWatts’ testimony because it was offered in\\nan effort to prove the plaintiff\\'s allegation\\nof negligence. This is not a proper inter-\\npretation of Josey.\\n\\nTo understand the rule, it is necessary to\\ncompare the three cases Josey distin-\\nguished with the holding of Josey and\\nHanna, The cases cited in Josey involved\\nsituations in which the negligence sought\\nto be proved was a defective condition in\\nthe defendant’s property (for example, an\\nimproperly secured awning or a burnt out\\ntrailer light). In such cases, the ultimate\\nissue of liability is whether the property\\nwas defective at the time of the accident;\\nthat is to say, similarity of circumstances\\nis a necessary predicate when the existence\\nof an object or condition at a given time\\nis in issue or is the gravamen of the action\\nor defense1 Therefore, any testimony\\nconcerning the condition of the property\\neither before or after the accident is highly\\npersuasive and should be corroborated by\\nproof that the condition had not changed\\nduring the interval to avoid misleading the\\njury?\\n\\nUnlike those cases, Josey, Hanna, and\\nthe instant case involved testimony con-\\n\\nnize the exceptions to this general rule. See,\\nfor example, Norwood Clinic v. Spann, 240\\nAla. 427, 199 So. 840 (1941), and Gulf, M. &\\nN. R. Co. v. Havard, 217 Ala. 689, 117 So.\\n228 (1938).\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\ncerning the position of objects or vehicles\\nat the scene of an automobile accident.\\nHere, this testimony was obviously not of-\\nfered in an effort to prove negligence. In-\\ndeed, the location of the defendant’s car\\nimmediately after impact rather than its lo-\\ncation as observed by Webb is more favor-\\nable to the plaintiff\\'s theory of liability.\\n\\nJosey did not intend to exclude all testi-\\nmony about the scene of an accident which\\ncould not be accompanied by evidence ac-\\ncounting for the interval between the acci-\\ndent and the witness’s observation. In\\nfact, both Josey and Hanna affirmed the\\nadmission of such testimony without proof\\nthat the objects or vehicles had not been\\nmoved. In cases where the testimony does\\nnot go directly to the ultimate issue of lia-\\nbility, but only constitutes one feature of a\\ncomposite of the witness’s observations, the\\nJosey court concluded that the right of\\ncross examination—to show all the sur-\\n\\nrounding facts and circumstances—would ©\\n\\namply protect the defendant. The credibil-\\nity and weight of the testimony is left to\\nthe jury. We hold, therefore, that the ex-\\nclusion of Watt’s testimony was error.\\n\\nWe conclude on a note of caution.\\nWhile the limited purpose of the question\\nin the instant case was readily apparent,\\nthere are often situations where it is not\\nclear from counsel’s question whether the\\nelicited proof of subsequent conditions at\\nthe accident site goes to the ultimate issue\\nof liability. An example can be seen in\\nthe case where proof is offered of repair\\nof premises after an accident. Evidence of\\nsubsequent repairs may be admitted for the\\nlimited purpose of showing the condition\\nof the premises at the time of the accident,\\nbut such evidence is not admissible as an\\nadmission of negligence by the defendant.\\nWhenever such evidence is offered, in test-\\ning its propriety it is entirely proper for\\nthe trial judge to require of counsel to\\nshow what issue his proffered proof ad-\\ndresses. Whenever such evidence is admit-\\nted, the party ‘opposing the evidence has a\\n\\nright to have the trial judge instruct the\\njury that the evidence is not admitted to\\nshow negligence bit for the limited pur-\\npose of allowing the party offering the ev-\\nidence to show the condition of the prem-\\nises (or other limited purpose) at the time\\nof the accident.

Furner, Bessemer, for appel-\\nlant.\\n\\n\\nThomas L. Foster, Birmingham, for ap-\\npellee.\\n\\nSHORES, Justice.\\n\\nThe litigants in this case are mother and\\ndaughter. Mrs. Moore was married to Mr.\\nMoore, Mrs. Jones’ father, for fifty-two\\n\\nyears prior to his death in 1974, During\\nthe course of their marriage they acquired\\na home in Birmingham, for which they\\npaid approximately $8,200. Mrs. Moore\\ntestified, and it was not contradicted, that\\nshe paid the earnest money on the house\\nand that she and her husband together paid\\nthe balance. Title to the property was\\nheld in their joint names with right of sur-\\nvivorship,\\n\\nHaving enjoyed good health all of his\\nlife, Mr. Moore was stricken with cancer\\nsometime in 1973, and spent some weeks in\\nthe hospital in the fall of 1973. He re-\\nturned home in October and remained\\nthere until he was readmitted to the hospi-\\ntal on January 16, 1974, at which time his\\ncondition was diagnosed as terminal. Mr.\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\nMoore never returned home and remained\\nhospitalized until his death on March 6,\\n1974.\\n\\nOn February 6, 1974, from his hospital\\nbed, Mr. Moore executed a deed conveying\\nhis one-half interest in the home to his and\\nMrs. Moore’s daughter. It is this deed\\nwhich is the subject of the controversy be-\\ntween these parties.\\n\\nMrs. Moore filed suit seeking to have ti-\\ntle to the subject property quieted in her\\nand asked the court to set aside the deed\\nexectited by her husband on the ground\\nthat Mr. Moore was, at the time of the ex~\\necution of the deed, mentally incompetent\\nto execute a valid conveyance of the land.\\n\\nThe trial court correctly held that Nunn\\nvu. Keith, 289 Ala. 518, 268 So.2d 792\\n(1972), had settled the question of whether\\none joint tenant in a survivorship deed is\\ncapable of conveying his interest in jointly\\nheld property absent the consent of the co-\\ntenant, and observed that the only issue re-\\nmaining for its determination was the men-\\ntal competency of Mr. Moore at the time\\nof the execution of the deed.\\n\\nThe trial court found that Mr. Moore\\nwas incompetent on February 6, 1974,\\nwhen he purported to convey his interest\\nin the property to his daughter.\\n\\nFrom this judgment, the daughter ap-\\npeals.\\n\\nIt is her argument that although the evi-\\ndence was taken ore tenus, that there was\\nno evidence to support the trial court’s\\nfinding that Mr. Moore was incompetent\\non that date.\\n\\nAppellant states in brief:\\n\\n“A detailed scrutiny of the evidence\\nfails to find any supportive of the claim\\nthat Robert Earl Moore, on February 6,\\n1975, was mentally incompetent to exe-\\ncute a deed. .” (Emphasis added)\\n\\nHt least five witnesses, other than\\nthe medical doctors, whose testimony was\\n\\nreceived by deposition, testified that fol-\\nlowing Mr. Moore’s illness they had ob-\\nserved him on numerous occasions, and at\\ntimes found him in a deteriorated state,\\nmentally; that he could not carry on ra-\\ntional conversations; sometimes drifted\\noff of one subject on to another; would\\nforget whether he had had meals; was in-\\ncapable of managing his affairs; incapable\\nof understanding what was going on, etc.\\nAdmittedly, the evidence is conflicting, and\\nwe see no purpose to be served in setting\\nall of it out. However, to illustrate that\\nappellant is wrong in her assertion that\\nthere was no evidence to support the trial\\ncourt’s finding, we do set out the follow-\\ning, which appears in the record:\\n\\nMr. Moore’s physicians’ notes, made at\\ntimes they examined him during his stay in\\nthe hospital, show the following:\\n\\n“1-24-74 Disoriented at times\\n“1/25/74 Appears pt’s mental\\nand physical status fluctuates\\n\\n“1/27 Pt appears depressed\\n\\n“1-28 Pt’s family con’t to be in tur-\\nmoil.

He was\\nmentally impaired from the’ stand-\\npoint of orientation, alertness, abili-\\nty to recall facts, ability to appre-\\nciate time, person, and place.”\\n\\nAlso in the record is a letter, which is as\\nfollows:\\n\\n“January 21, 1974\\n\\n“TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\\n\\n“This is to certify that I have examined\\nRobert L. Moore, white male of 73 years\\nwho resides at 1124 McMillan Avenue,\\nS.W., Birmingham 35211, on 1/20/74\\n\\nfollowing his admission to the Baptist\\nMedical Center-Montclair and have\\nfound him to be suffering from damage\\nof the central nervous system so as to\\nrender him incompetent in the manage-\\nment of his own affairs. This condition\\nis expected to be permanent.\\n\\n“/s/ Joe D. Bancroft, M.D.\\nJoe D. Bancroft, M.D.”\\n\\nDr. Bancroft explained that it was his\\nopinion that Mr. Moore was suffering\\nfrom two disorders of the central nervous\\nsystem, arteriosclerosis and tumor of the\\nbrain, both of which he said were incura-\\nble and progressive, and that both condi-\\ntions affect a person’s reasoning ability.\\n\\nAgainst this evidence was the testimony\\nof the appellant, who testified that her fa-\\nther was capable of knowing what he was\\ndoing on the day he signed the deed. It\\nwas her testimony that her father had con-\\nveyed his interest in the home of her par-\\nents to her so that his wife would have a\\nhome.\\n\\nIt is her argument that the testimony\\ntaken ore tenus was insufficient to support\\nthe trial court’s conclusion, and that the\\ncentral issue of Mr. Moore’s competency\\nmust be decided on the basis of the medical\\nevidence received by deposition.\\n\\nWe disagree with the appellant.\\n\\nHM Appellant appears to argue that no\\nlay witnesses testified with absolute cer-\\ntainty that Mr. Moore was incompetent on\\nthe exact day that the deed was executed.\\nWe have carefully read the entire record.\\nAll of the witnesses who testified had\\nknown Mr. Moore for a number of years,\\nand had seen him frequently after he was\\nhospitalized with his final illness. We\\nthink they were competent to give an opin-\\njon, based upon their observation of him,\\nas to Mr. Moore’s mental capacity at the\\ntime of the execution of the deed in ques-\\ntion. In Blackwell v. Sewall, 280 Ala. 359,\\n365, 194 So.2d 519, 525 (1967), we said:\\n\\n“Tt appears to be the doctrine of our\\ncases that whether a witness is qualified\\n\\n36\\n\\nto deliver a non-expert opinion, favor-\\nable or unfavorable, upon the issue of\\nmental capacity, is a question submitted\\nto the sound discretion of the trial court,\\na discretion not reversible unless plainly\\nerroneous. Wear v. Wear, 200 Ala. 345,\\n76 So. 111; Price v. Marshall, 255 Ala.\\n447, 52 So.2d 149; Haghart v. Cooley,\\n278 Ala. 354, 178 So.2d 266.”\\n\\nHM The thrust of appellant’s argument\\nis that since no witness who testified said\\nwith absolute certainty that they saw Mr.\\nMoore on the exact date that the deed was\\nsigned, that none of them was in a position\\nto testify with regard to his mental condi-\\ntion on that day. Although many of them\\ntestified that they had visited with him pe-\\nriodically during the period in which he\\nwas hospitalized, she asserts that only she\\nand a practical nurse, who was in attend-\\nance at the time the deed was signed, were\\nin a position to give an opinion as to his\\ncondition on that day. Under our cases,\\nwe do not think it is necessary to sustain\\nthe trial court’s finding that such precision\\nis necessary. As indicated, the medical ev-\\nidence was that Mr. Moore was mentally\\nimpaired and had been since he suffered a\\nstroke in early January. It was Dr. Ban-\\ncroft’s opinion that the condition was pro-\\ngressive and permanent,\\n\\nThe rule has been repeatedly stated by\\nthis court, and appears as follows in Hall\\nv. Britton, 216 Ala. 265, 267, 113 So. 238,\\n239 (1927) :\\n\\n“In order to render a deed void be-\\ncause of the mental incapacity of the\\ngrantor—and the principle is the same\\nfor any other signatory—the test is ‘not\\nmerely that the grantor’s mental powers\\nwere impaired, but whether he had suffi-\\ncient capacity to understand in a reason-\\nable manner the nature and effect of the\\nact which he was doing’ 18 Corp.Jur.\\n218, § 131; White v. Farley, 81 Ala. 563,\\n8 So. 215; Stanfill v. Johnson, 159 Ala.\\n546, 49 So. 223.” ;\\n\\nwhich was quoted with approval in Casey\\nv. Krump, 260 Ala, 280, 69 So.2d 864\\n\\n(1954), which noted that the rule had been\\nfollowed also in Spence v. Spence, 239 Ala.\\n480, 195 So. 717 (1940).\\n\\nThe next point made by appellant is that\\nthe ore tenus rule does not attach since,\\nshe contends, the lay witnesses were not\\nqualified to state an opinion, and the only\\nremaining evidence of Mr. Moore’s inca-\\npacity was by way of depositions of the\\nphysicians.

John C. Henley, III (ap-\\npellant), the other co-trustee, whose cros:\\nbill seeking removal of BTNB as co-trus-\\ntee and other relief was denied, now ap-\\n\\n\\n42\\n\\n. peals the order of instructions and ratifica-\\ntion given BTNB.\\n\\nThe Trust involved is the Linn-Henley\\nCharitable Trust which was established by\\nthe will of Walter E. Henley, the uncle of\\nappellant Henley, Walter Henley was a\\nmember of the Board of Directors of\\nBTNB for a period in excess of 50-years\\nand President and Chairman of the Board\\nof the Birmingham Realty Company. The\\ntrust corpus consisted almost entirely of\\nstock, one-half of which was BTNB stock.\\nThe beneficiaries of the Trust, selected by\\nthe co-trustees, are limited to:\\n\\n“... any corporation or organiza-\\n\\ntion organized and operated exclusively\\nfor religious, charitable, scientific, liter-\\nary or educational purposes\\nwhose activities are exclusively within\\nthe geographical limits of Jefferson\\nCounty, ‘Alabama or . . which\\nmaintain branch operations within Jef-\\nferson County .  . [but any\\namounts distributed to the latter] must\\nbe expended within Jefferson\\nCounty . .”\\n\\nIn the fall of 1968, the management of\\nBTNB decided that it would be advanta-\\ngeous to change its corporate structure\\n\\nfrom a National Banking Association to.\\n\\nthat of a “holding company.” When this\\nmerger was completed, the new structure\\nwould consist of a national bank known\\nas the Alabama National Bank, and a Del-\\naware business corporation known as the\\nBTNB Corporation which would own all\\nof the stock of the “new” national bank.\\n\\nThe plan of merger, as governed by the\\nNational Banking Act, 12 U.S.C. § 21a,\\nwas that the existing bank would be\\nmerged into the “new” bank. The “new”\\nbank would not issue stock in the National\\nBanking Association to the shareholders of\\nthe “old” bank, but instead would issue one\\nshare of stock of the “new” bank directly\\nto the Delaware business corporation in\\nexchange for stock of the existing bank.\\nThe Delaware corporation would then is-\\nsute one share of stock of that corporation\\n\\nfor each share of stock in Birmingham\\nTrust National Bank turned in for conver-\\nsion. When these various steps were com-\\npleted, each former shareholder of Bir-\\nmingham Trust National Bank would hold\\nstock of the Delaware business corporation\\nknown as BINB Corporation.\\n\\nAlthough over 80% of the stockholders\\nwere in favor of this merger, Henley was\\nopposed to it since he felt that from an in-\\nvestment viewpoint the stock of “old”\\nBTINB was more desirable. Thereupon,\\nunder authority of 12 U.S.C. § 61(3),\\nwhich states that in a situation where a\\nnational bank and one or more individuals\\nare co-trustees of a trust containing stock\\nof the national bank, the shares of the\\nbank stock may be voted by the individual\\nco-trustee as though he were sole trustee,\\nHenley voted both his personal stock and\\nthe Trust’s 27,460 shares against the merg-\\ner, and made extensive remarks in support\\nof his position at the stockholders’ meet-\\ning. The merger was approved by the\\nComptroller and became effective on De-\\ncember 31, 1968,\\n\\nOn January 30, 1969, Henley informed\\nBTNB that the Trust was dissenting from\\nthe merger. BTNB, to state it mildly, was\\nquite incensed at this course of action pur-\\nsued by Henley and unsuccessfully at-\\ntempted to persuade him not to continue\\nwith his planned avenue of dissent.\\n\\nThe President of BTNB even arranged\\na meeting between Henley and one J.\\nCraig Smith, a director of BTNB and\\nChairman of the Board of Avondale Mills,\\nin the hope that Smith could persuade\\nHenley not to dissent from the merger. It\\nseems that Henley’s company, Birmingham\\nPublishing Company, had for some years\\nbeen responsible for printing the annual\\nreports of Avondale Mills. In fact, one\\nyear earlier Birmingham Publishing Com-\\npany performed over $30,000 worth of\\nservices for Avondale Mills. Conspicuous-\\nly, however, after this meeting with Smith,\\nwherein Henley refused to alter his stand,\\nBirmingham Publishing’s business with\\n\\n\\n43,\\n\\nAvondale Mills dwindled to $640 two years\\nlater.\\n\\nThe statutory procedure for dissent by a\\nstockholder in the present situation is out-\\nlined in 12 U.S.C. § 215a(b), (c) and (d).\\nIn substance, that procedure is as follows:\\nThose shareholders who are opposed to the\\nmerger, as was the Trust, shall be entitled\\nto receive the value of the shares they hold\\nafter the merger is approved by giving the\\nreceiving association (the “new” bank) no-\\ntice of such intent at any time before thir-\\nty days after the date of consummation of\\nthe merger, and by surrendering the stock\\ncertificates.\\n\\nThe value of the shares of any dissent-\\ning shareholder shall be ascertained by an\\nappraisal made by a committee of three\\npersons, composed of (1) one selected by\\nthe vote of the holders of the stock who\\nare dissenting; (2) one selected by the di-\\nrectors of the “new” bank; and (3) one\\nselected by the two so selected.\\n\\nIf, within 90 days of the consummation\\nof the merger, for any reason one or more\\nof the appraisers are not selected, or they\\nfail to determine the value of the shares,\\nthe Comptroller, upon written request of\\nany interested party, shall determine the\\nvalue of the shares which shall be final\\nand binding on all parties. This amount\\nshall be promptly paid to the dissenting\\nshareholders by the “new” bank, Then\\nthose shares of the “new” bank which\\nwould have gone to the shareholders in ex-\\nchange for their shares of “old” bank\\nstock, had they not dissented, shall be ‘sold\\nat an advertised public auction. The\\n“new” bank has the right to bid on the\\n“new” stock, and if the price paid at this\\nauction is greater than that paid to the dis-\\nsenting shareholders, the difference shall\\nbe paid to the dissenting shareholders. If\\nthe “new” bank is the highest bidder at\\nthis auction, it shall resell these shares\\nwithin 30 days thereafter to such person or\\npersons as it shall desire.\\n\\nHenley, in compliance with the statute,\\ngave BTNB notice of his intent to dissent\\n\\nand surrendered the shares held by the\\n‘Trust. Henley appointed one appraiser,\\nthough no notice was given to BTNB of\\nsuch appointment, and BTNB did not ap-\\npoint anyone to appraise the value of the\\nstock. Neither Henley nor BTNB com-\\nplied with the 90-day requirement of noti-\\nfying the Comptroller should the appraisers\\nnot be appointed or be unable to agree as\\nto the value of the stock. In fact, Henley\\nnever gave notice to the Comptroller and\\nBTNB did not do so until September 23,\\nalmost eight months after the merger.\\n\\nThe Comptroller finally did determine\\nthe value of the shares of $32.80 a share,\\nfor a total of $900,688. Neither co-trustee\\nsubmitted any pertinent information to the\\nComptroller which might have aided him\\nin reaching his decision as to the value of\\nthe shares.\\n\\nAs required by the statute, BTNB then\\noffered for sale at auction the holding\\ncompany stock, i. e., the equivalent of the\\nstock of the old bank. The only bid was\\nby BTNB Corporation—the holding com-\\npany—for $26 per share. Since this bid\\ndid not exceed the $32.80 per share pre-\\nviously paid by the dissenting shareholders,\\nno further payment was made by BINB to\\nthe Trust.\\n\\nIn addition to the foregoing transaction,\\nHenley also wished to persuade BTNB to\\nallow the Trust to purchase stock in Bir-\\nmingham Realty Company. The company,\\nof which Walter Henley was a substantial\\nstockholder, originally owned about 2700\\nacres where the City of Birmingham is lo-\\ncated. It still owns in excess of 200 par-\\ncels of real estate in the area.\\n\\nHenley’s argumient in favor of purchas-\\ning more stock in Birmingham Realty was\\nbased on his contention that Walter Hen-\\nley had in the past discussed with him his\\ndesire to bring control of the company to\\nBirmingham from New York. In 1970,\\nabout 5% of the outstanding stock in Bir-\\nmingham Realty came up for sale. If the\\nstock could be acquired, the New York\\nholdings in the company would be reduced\\n\\n\\n44\\n\\nbelow 20% and control would then be cen-\\ntered in Birmingham. Henley began nego-\\ntiations and was told that the stock, with a\\nbook value of $900 per share, could be pur-\\nchased for $650 per share. BTNB refused\\nto agree to the purchase. It was stipulated\\nthat the last trade of Birmingham Realty\\nstock before the trial was 5 shares at $1800\\nper share on May 14, 1973, and that less\\nthan 10 shares were offered by the Mont-\\ngomery office of Sterne, Agee and Leach\\nat a price of $2050 per share.\\n\\nIn April, 1970, Henley demanded further\\npayment by BTNB to the Trust. (Prior to\\nthis, BTNB had mistakenly paid $32,952 as\\ndividends on stock of the Delaware Corpo-\\nration since the Trust no longer owned the\\nstock, and had offered to pay the Trust\\n$28,211 or approximately 614 % interest on\\nthe appraised value of the BTNB stock\\nwhich it had had the use of for more than\\na year.) After an extended period of un-\\nfruitful negotiations between the two co-\\ntrustees, BTNB petitioned the circuit court\\nfor instructions and ratification of pre-\\nvious acts.\\n\\nThe issue presented, then, is whether ei-\\nther or both BTNB and Henley, as co-\\ntrustees of a charitable trust, are guilty of\\na breach of their fiduciary duty owed to\\nthe Trust as trustees. We find that both\\nare guilty of such a breach.\\n\\nHl initially, we would point out, irre-\\nspective of Henley’s contentions, that we\\nare not here to decide the propriety vel\\nnon of BTNB’s decision to merge itself\\nfrom a national banking association to that\\nof a “holding company.” This is a decision\\nsolely within the discretion of the directors\\nand shareholders of BTNB. As previously\\nnoted, the option of dissent was readily\\navailable to those who were in disagree-\\nment with that decision, Thus, Henley’s\\nargument in this respect is without merit.\\n\\nHl it is a fundamental rule of law that\\na trustee must act in good faith and dis-\\nplay complete loyalty to the interests of his\\n\\nbeneficiaries. First National Bank of Bir-\\nmingham v. Basham, 238 Ala. 500, 191 So.\\n873 (1939); Barker v. First National Bank\\nof Birmingham, 20 F.Supp. 185 (D.C., Ala.\\n\\n* 1937). It is this duty, in our opinion, that\\n\\nthe co-trustees have breached.\\n\\nThe primary error in the decree of the\\nlower court can clearly be seen when it\\nstated:\\n\\n“There has been no breach of fiduci-\\nary duties under the trust by Complain-\\nant. By this finding, this Court does not\\nintend to state that there have not been\\ninstances, in its part in the execution of\\nthe trust, where Complainant has acted\\nunwisely or precipitately. It must have\\nbeen apparent to Complainant and its,\\ntrust officers that, from time to time,\\nduring the life span of the trust to date,\\na division of opinion relating to the wis-\\ndom or propriety of the execution of the\\ntrust affairs was involved as between the\\nco-trustees. When such a division of\\nopinion became apparent, Complainant\\nshould have, by proper written petition\\nor even by informal discussions with its\\nco-trustee and this Court, sought, in ad-\\nvance of any direct action on the disput-\\ned action, a resolution thereof and a con-\\nfirmation by a directive of this Court.\\nBut this opportunity and duty was also\\navailable to and incumbent upon the co-\\ntrustee. Hereafter, in the management\\nand execution of the trust, the co-trust-\\nees are admonished to avail themselves of\\nthe services, advice, sanctions and direc-\\ntives of this Court whenever they cannot\\nagree or whenever, even if they do\\nagree, the matter under consideration is\\nof unusual import or complexity.” [Em-\\nphasis supplied.]\\n\\nHMM The trial Judge was correct when\\nhe determined that BTNB should have\\n\\nsought a resolution of this problem in ad-\\nvance of any direct action on its part.\\nGilmer v. Gilmer, 245 Ala. 450, 17 So.2d\\n529 (1944). The crux of the controversy,\\nhowever, as found by the Court, is not the\\nrelative right or fault of the co-trustees,\\n\\n\\nee 45\\nbe\\n\\nbut rather the separate and several duties\\nof each to the Trust; and any breach on\\nthe part of one co-trustee would certainly\\nnot excuse those duties of good faith and\\nloyalty owed by the other co-trustee.\\nAfter all, charitable trusts are especially\\nfavored in equity. Mastin v. First Nation-\\nal Bank of Mobile, Inc., 278 Ala. 251, 177\\nSo.2d 808 (1965). Thus, this suit is clearly\\nnot concerned with the rights and duties of\\none co-trustee as opposed to those of the\\nother, but solely with those of the Trust.\\nThe principle of contributory or compara-\\ntive fault or neglect as between co-trustees\\nplays no role in measuring the proper dis-\\ncharge of this high duty imposed by law on\\neach trustee.\\n\\nWe will first deal with the breach\\nby both BTNB and Henley in their han-\\ndling of the Trust’s interest in the dissent\\nprocedure. Under the outlined procedure\\nof dissent, three appraisers were to be se-\\nlected. Henley selected one but failed to\\nnotify BTNB of such selection and BTNB\\nneglected to select an appraiser at all.\\nConsequently, the third appraiser could not\\nbe selected. Additionally, this step not\\nhaving been complied with, a Comptroller\\nshould have been notified within 90 days\\nfrom the date of the merger. Henley did\\nnot give such notice at all, and BITNB did\\nnot give it until about eight months after\\nthe merger. BTNB attempts to excuse its\\nfailure to appoint an appraiser by Henley’s\\nfailure to notify it of his selection, and\\nthat the’ second procedure of allowing the\\nComptroller to make the appraisal was al-\\nways available in lieu of selecting the three\\nappraisers.\\n\\nThese were acts of contest and struggle\\nbetween the co-trustees and can hardly be\\nsaid to be acts of good faith and exercises\\nof undivided loyalty on the part of either\\nco-trustee. Every step possible to insure\\nthat the Trust assets were protected should\\nhave been taken; and it was incumbent\\nupon each to comply with the fiduciary\\nstandards required of a trustee irrespective\\n\\nof the default of the other. The default of\\neach is apparent and inexcusable.\\n\\nHl Henley contends that BTNB should\\nhave at least temporarily removed itself as\\na co-trustee when it was notified of the\\nTrust’s decision to dissent from the merg-\\ner. A conflict of interest was apparent,\\nsays Henley, since BTNB was placed in a\\nposition whereby on the one hand it had\\nthe duty as a co-trustee to see that the\\nTrust received the highest price possible\\nfor the stock and, on the other, as the pur-\\nchaser of the stock, to see that the lowest\\npossible price was paid.\\n\\nBTNB contends that there was no in-\\ncumbent duty upon it to resign and that\\nthere was no conflict of interest since\\nHenley’s decision that the Trust would dis-\\nsent from the merger forced them into the\\nsituation where they became both a seller\\nand a purchaser; also, the dilemma was\\nresolved by the statutory dissent procedure\\navailable. With this we cannot agree.\\nHenley did not force BTNB into this situ-\\nation by merely exercising a legal right in\\nfavor of the Trust; but it was the duty of\\nBTNB to recognize the obvious conflict of\\ninterest which resulted and resolve it by at\\nleast temporarily resigning as trustee.\\n\\nA breach of the co-trustees’ duties\\ncan be seen in the alternative step of hav-\\ning the Comptroller fix the value of the\\nstock, Neither co-trustee submitted any\\npertinent information to the Comptroller\\nwhich might have enabled him to make a\\nmore favorable determination of the value\\nof the Trust’s BTNB stock. Henley re-\\nquested annual reports and “internal au-\\ndits” of BTNB for the five years preced-\\ning the merger. The reports were deliv-\\nered but the “audits” were not, BTNB\\nstated that the audits did not contain any\\ninformation which would be pertinent to\\nthe Comptroller’s appraisal of the stock,\\nHenley excuses his failure to submit any\\ninformation to the Comptroller on BTNB’s\\nfailure to supply the audit information.\\n\\n\\nBTNB attempts to excuse its failure to\\nsubmit information to the Comptroller for\\ntwo reasons:\\n\\nFirst, due to Henley’s decision to dissent,\\nhe became, for all practical purposes, the\\nsole trustee and thus the duty to submit the\\ninformation fell on his shoulders and off\\nthose of BTNB. (This contention of itself\\nreveals the inherent conflict of interest.)\\n\\nSecondly, since the Comptroller already\\npossessed extensive information about\\nBTNB as a result of the national bank ex-\\namination performed two or three times a\\nyear, there was no need on their part to\\nsubmit any additional information. (This\\nvirtually admits a default in the discharge\\nof its obligation.)\\n\\nAgain, we cannot agree that the acts or\\nomissions of either co-trustee excused the\\nsubsequent breach of duty by the other co-\\ntrustee. BTNB and Henley should have\\neach taken the initiative to submit as much\\ninformation as possible to the Comptroller\\nto enable him to make an accurate apprais-\\nal of the stock’s value.\\n\\nHI Notwithstanding the foregoing.\\nBTNB contends that the Comptroller’s ap-\\npraisal, as stated in 12 U.S.C. § 215a(d),\\n“shall be final and binding on all parties” ;\\nand that even if such appraisal was not fi-\\nnal and binding, it could only be reviewed\\nby a direct proceeding in which the Comp-\\ntroller was a party. That is to say,\\nBTNB’s contention is that federal law has\\npreempted this entire area of law and that\\na state court, therefore, is precluded from\\nreviewing the Comptroller’s appraisal.\\nHere, again, this contention proceeds on\\nthe false premise that the controversy is\\nlimited to BTNB and Henley. Moreover,\\nthe flaw in this contention is that we are\\nnot reviewing the finding of the Comptrol-\\nler. We are reviewing the acts of the co-\\ntrustees, as such acts relate to their fiduci-\\nary duties to the Trust, which supervisory\\njurisdiction has not been preempted by the\\n\\nfederal statutes and rests exclusively with\\nthe state court,\\n\\nBTNB contends that, assuming the\\nComptroller’s appraisal was affected by the\\nactions or inactions of either co-trustee,\\nthe Comptroller’s decision is not subject to\\nreview under authority of Heikkila v. Bar-\\nber, 345 U.S. 229, 73 S.Ct. 603, 97 L.Ed. 972\\n(1953), and Crane v. Hahlo, 258 U.S. 142,\\n42 S.Ct. 214, 66 L.Ed. 514 (1922). Neither\\ncase supports such contention,\\n\\n‘In Heikkila, an alien was deported by\\norder of the Attorney General under au-\\nthority of § 19(a)1 of the Immigration Act\\nof 1917, which states that such order “shall\\nbe final.” Judicial review was proscribed\\nby the very terms of the Act and the com-\\nplaining parties sought just such a review.\\nThe Court recognized habeas corpus, in\\nwhich issues not administratively adjudi-\\ncated under the Act could be raised, as the\\nonly available remedy.\\n\\nCrane was concerned with the amount of\\ndamages awarded in an eminent domain\\nproceeding by the Board of Revision of\\nAssessments in which the statute authoriz-\\ning such proceeding provided that the\\naward was final and conclusive. Both of\\nthese cases deal with efforts to review the\\nmerits of previously adjudicated issues ex-\\npressly contrary to the proscription con-\\ntained in the Act authorizing the proceed-\\nings; and the principle which dictated the\\nresult in each case is distinguishable from\\nthe case at bar in that the issue before us\\n—the fidelity vel non of a co-trustee—has\\nnot been, nor could it have been, adjudicat-\\ned.\\n\\nThat the preemption doctrine has a field\\nof operation can be seen from the case of\\nRogers v. First National Bank of St.\\nGeorge, 297 F.Supp. 641 (D.C., S.C., 1969),\\nwhich held that national bank merger pro-\\ncedures are controlled by federal and not\\nstate law. The Federal Act does not ad-\\n\\n1, 89 Stat. 889, as amended, 54 Stat. 1238, 8 U.S.C., § 155(a).\\n\\n\\n47\\n\\ndress itself, however, to fiduciary duties,*\\nand this is recognized by the final section\\nof the Act which prohibits discrimination\\nin the removal of a merging bank, as a\\ntrustee, by a state court on the sole ground\\nthat it has availed itself of the merger pro-\\ncedure authorized by the federal banking\\nlaws. The federal law cannot preempt that\\nwhich it does not include nor purport to\\ndeal with. The state law is, and necessari-\\nly must remain, fully intact with respect to\\nits supervisory jurisdiction of trust estates.\\n\\nWe now turn to Henley’s contention that\\nBTNB’s refusal to consent to the purchase\\nof Birmingham Realty Company stock for\\nthe Trust was premised on consideration\\nfor its private interest and not those of the\\nTrust. Credence is given to this conten-\\ntion by the testimony of a BTNB trust of-\\nficer when he stated:\\n\\n“T think there were probably two prin-\\ncipal disadvantages concerning the sub-\\nstantial ownership of the Trust would\\nhave had in Birmingham Realty Compa-\\nny, one would have been that the stock\\ncould have been pivotal in perhaps con-\\ntroversial decisions of the corporation,\\nand we do not think that would have\\nbeen something we would have liked at\\nthe time. A number of people who are\\nprincipals, or who were principals of\\nBirmingham Realty Company at the time\\nor directly interested in the company,\\nwere good friends and customers of the\\nBank, and it could also have been con-\\n\\nxy\\n\\nThe reference here to “fiduciary duties” is\\nto be understood in the context of the law of\\ntrusts; the reference is not to those duties\\nowed by a bank to its dissenting stockholders\\nabsent the trustee relationship. Indeed, as\\nto ordinary stockholders who dissent from the\\nmerger, the Federal Act contemplates that a\\nbank is cast in an adversary role—a role\\nabhorred by the law of trusts.\\n\\n3. Justice Cardozo, speaking for the majority\\nin Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, 164\\nNB. 545 (1928), said: “Many forms of\\nconduct permissible in a workaday world for\\nthose acting at arm’s length, are forbidden to\\nthose bound by fiduciary ties, A. trustee is\\nheld to something stricter than the morals of\\n\\nceivable that a situation would have de-\\nveloped . . wherein the interest of\\nthe Trust would have been adverse to\\nthe interest of those individuals, which\\nwould have placed the Bank in a situa-\\ntion of where regardless of what we did\\nwe might have been criticized for it.\\n\\n“We do not think that owning that\\nmuch stock of the company would have\\nbeen desirable, principally for those rea-\\nsons.”\\n\\nHH As stated in Barker v. First Na-\\ntional Bank of Birmingham, supra, when\\nreferring to the duties of a trustee, “all\\npersonal or selfish interests and all consid-\\neration of the interests of third parties\\nmust be excluded. His must be an undi-\\nvided loyalty.”\\n\\nHH Clearly, if the foregoing statement\\nis the true reason for BTNB’s refusal to\\npurchase the stock, then it has committed a\\ndefinite breach of its fiduciary duty.\\n\\nBTNB asserts that its reasons for refus-\\ning to purchase the Birmingham Realty\\nstock are as follows:\\n\\n1) The purchase would concentrate too\\nmuch of the Trust’s assets in a\\nclosely held corporation.\\n\\n2) The stock provided low income\\nwhich might prove troublesome un-\\nder the Tax Reform Act of 1969.\\n\\nthe market place. Not honestly alone, but the\\npunetilio of an honor the most sensitive, is\\nthen the standard of behavior. As to this\\nthere has developed a tradition that is un-\\nbending and inveterate.  Uncompromising\\nrigidity has been the attitude of courts of\\nequity when petitioned to undermine the rule\\nof undivided loyalty by the ‘disintegrating\\nerosion’ of particular exceptions. Wendt v.\\nFischer, 243 N.Y. 439, 444, 154 N.B. 808.\\nOnly thus has the level of conduct for fidu-\\nciaries been kept at a level higher than that\\ntrodden by the crowd.

Missisippi Valley\\nGenerating Co., 364 U.S. 520, SL S.Ct. 294, 5\\nL.Ba.2d 268 (1961).\\n\\n\\n3) Since it was a closely held company,\\nthe stock would be difficult to sell.\\n\\n4) The value of the stock would be dif-\\nficult to determine.\\n\\n5) Owning this much stock would make\\nthe Trust influential in company af-\\nfairs, perhaps pivotal in conflicts\\namong the controlling shareholders,\\nand would create a situation wherein\\nconflict between the co-trustees\\nmight be encouraged.\\n\\n6) There was no proof in the will that\\nWalter E. Henley desired for the\\nTrust to make such a purchase.\\n\\n7) The purchase would have no rela-\\ntion to the avowed charitable pur-\\npose of the Trust, and\\n\\n8) If the Trust were allowed to pur-\\nchase the stock, then Henley and his\\ncousin, Carl Wittichen, already a\\nsubstantial stockholder of Birming~-\\nham Realty Company, would then\\neffectively control 18% of Birming-\\nham Realty Company.\\n\\nWhen taken together, and fully analyzed,\\nthese reasons are but supportive of the\\nconclusions stated in the trust officer’s tes-\\ntimony and demonstrate the legal conclu-\\nsiveness of the conflict of interest on be-\\nhalf of BTNB with respect to this transac-\\ntion,\\n\\nHE Next, BTNB contends that, as-\\nsuming some breach of duty on their part,\\nno evidence was adduced showing that any\\ndamage to the Trust resulted therefrom,\\nIndeed, the anomaly encountered in obtain-\\ning any “after the fact” remedy on behalf\\nof the Trust is readily apparent. The bank\\nstock, the value of which is the principal\\nasset involved, is gone. So is the Birming-\\nham Realty stock. But the difficulty of\\nascertaining the loss, if any, suffered by\\nthe Trust can never be a legal ground for\\nratification of such flagrant abuse of fidu-\\nciary duties by the co-trustee. If difficulty\\nof solution were the basis for denying a\\n\\nremedy, hardly any field of operation\\nwould exist for the equity arm of the\\nCourt.\\n\\nHE We recognize that our remand of\\nthis cause with instructions for resubmis-\\nsion of the issue of damages to the Trust,\\nif any, places on the trial court a responsi-\\nbility which would not have arisen had\\nthere been a good faith utilization of the\\nprocedure set out in the Federal Act with\\nregard to, placing a value on the bank\\nstock, But, here again, federal law con-\\ntemplates faithful discharge of fiduciary\\nduties, and does not speak to fiduciary ac-\\ncountability. Therefore, the guilty trustee\\ncannot be heard to complain that its mis-\\nconduct invites, with its attendant risks, a\\nstate court review and determination of\\nliability for damages, if any, to the Trust.\\nAs we have previously observed, state\\ncourts exercising supervisory jurisdiction\\nover trusts provide the only available fo-\\nrum for such review and determination,\\n\\nTM This case is remanded to the trial\\nCourt with the following instructions:\\n\\n1. Appoint a Temporary Trustee of the\\nTrust Estate in lieu of the named co-\\ntrustees for the sole and limited pur-\\npose of the retrial of this cause.\\n\\n2. Upon resubmission of this cause,\\nmake the following specific findings\\nof fact and conclusions:\\n\\nDetermine what data should, and ex-\\ncept for the conflict of interests of\\nthe co-trustee—BTNB—would, have\\nbeen made available to the Comp-\\ntroller; and, from such data, fix the\\nvalue of the “old” bank stock as of\\nthe time such ascertainment is con-\\ntemplated by the Federal Act. If\\nthe value as fixed is more than the\\nvalue fixed by the Comptroller,\\naward to the Trust as damages the\\nsum equal to the difference against\\nBINB.\\n\\nIn which latter event (if the fixed\\nvalue per share exceeds $32.80), de-\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b;\\n\\n\\n(¢\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(e)\\n\\n49\\n\\ntermine the true bid value of the\\n“new” bank stock had BTNB, absent\\nits conflict of interests, actively\\nsought potential bidders as of the\\ntime of the public auction as pro-\\nvided by the Federal Act. If the bid\\nvalue so fixed is higher than the as-\\ncertained value of the stock as fixed\\nunder (a) above, award to the Trust\\nas additional damages the sum equal\\nto such difference against BTNB.\\n\\nIf the ascertained value of the “old”\\nbank stock is less than $32.80 per\\nshare, but the per share auction\\nvalue as fixed under (b) above ex-\\nceeds $32.80, award to the Trust as\\ndamages thé sum equal to the ag-\\ngtegate of the difference between\\nsuch per share auction value and\\n$32.80 against BTNB.\\n\\nIt is suggested that the price obtained\\nby BTNB upon resale of the “new”\\nstock within the 30-day period fol-\\nlowing the auction, as prescribed by\\n§ 215a(d), is relevant data (sub-\\nject, of course, to any admissible\\nevidence of price variance) for con-\\nsideration in making such determi-\\nnation. .\\n\\nDetermine whether the ascertainable\\ntrue value of Birmingham Realty\\nstock and the asking price therefor\\nof the “N, Y. block,” along with\\nthe other material factors, rendered\\nBTNB’s conflict of interests respon-\\nsible for an abuse of discretion in\\nrefusing to agree to such purchase.\\nIf so, award to the Trust as dam-\\nages such sum as the Court may\\ndeem reasonable and adequate to\\nmake the Trust whole in light of all\\ncompetent evidence adduced on this\\nissue,\\n\\nDetermine whether BTNB’s evi-\\ndenced conflict of interests is so in-\\nherent in the nature of its relation-\\nship to the Trust and to the Co-trus-\\ntee Henley as to render BTNB dis-\\n\\nqualified to further serve as co-trus-\\ntee to the instant Trust Estate; or,\\nwhether the resolution of the instant\\ncontroversy will so dissolve the con-\\nflict of interests as to render BTNB\\nfully competent and qualified to\\nserve as co-trustee; and to imple-\\nment by order of the Court such de-\\ntermination as the interest of the\\nTrust Estate may require.\\n\\n3. Determination and award of expens-\\nes and fees chargeable against the\\nTrust Estate shall be limited to those\\nreasonably and necessarily incurred\\nby the Temporary Trustee and his\\nattorney.\\n\\nHs In conclusion, we observe that the\\nAttorney General of the State of Alabama\\nwas made a party to this litigation as au-\\nthorized by State v. Bibb, 234 Ala. 46, 173\\nSo. 74 (1937). The record shows that the\\nAttorney General filed an answer request\\ning in effect that the Court protect the in-\\nterests of the beneficiaries to the charita-\\nble Trust. Except for one apologetic refer-\\nence made by the trial Judge to his failure\\nto recognize the representative from the\\nAttorney General’s office for the purpose\\nof examining a witness, the record is moot\\nas to any participation by the Attorney\\nGeneral in the trial of this cause. The\\nwisdom of Bibb, authorizing representation\\nof the beneficiaries of a charitable trust by\\nthe Attorney General, is abundantly exem-\\nplified by the posture of the record in this\\ncase. We have noted this fact merely to\\ncomment that we deem appropriate the ac-\\ntive participation by the office of the At-\\ntorney General on behalf of the benefi-\\nciaries of the Trust Estate upon retrial of\\nthis cause.\\n\\nReversed and remanded with instruc-\\ntions.\\n\\nMERRILL, ALMON, and EMBRY, JJ.,\\nconcur.\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\nSHORES, J., concurs in the result.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C. J. and MADDOZ, J., dis-\\nsent,\\n\\nBLOODWORTH and FAULKNER, JJ.,\\nnot sitting,\\n\\nMADDOX, Justice, (dissenting).\\n\\nEveryone seems to agree that this is a\\nunique case, but as I view it, there is just\\none legal question—what is the duty of a\\nnational bank in consolidation or merger\\nproceedings, when the bank is co-trustee of\\na charitable trust, and a major asset of the\\ntrust is the stock of the bank?\\n\\nThe majority opinion sets out the facts\\nand I shall not restate them, but I do list a\\nfew of the basic points for a better under-\\nstanding of my dissent. This charitable\\ntrust was established by the late Walter\\nHenley who was a director, a president\\nand later chairman of the board of Bir-\\nmingham Trust National Bank, one of the\\nco-trustees. This controversy arose when\\nBTNB decided to merge into a holding\\ncompany. The other co-trustee, John C.\\nHenley, III, was opposed to the merger.\\n\\nIn this proceeding, the trial judge, after\\nhearing extensive testimony, did not find\\nthat the bank had been disloyal to the\\ntrust, although he did point out that the\\nbank and Henley should have received in-\\nstructions in advance. The attorney gener-\\nal, representing the beneficiaries of the\\ncharitable trust, does not question the trial\\ncourt’s finding of no disloyalty on the part\\nof BTNB.\\n\\nMy dissent is based on these basic\\npoints :\\n\\n1, Under the facts of this case, I find\\nno prejudicial error in the trial court’s de-\\ntermination that the bank was not disloyal;\\n\\n2, The conduct of fiduciary business by\\nBTNB, a national bank, was governed by\\nfederal law and regulation;\\n\\n3. Since there was no cross-appeal, I\\nbelieve this Court exceeds its appellate ju-\\nrisdiction when it finds that co-trustee\\nHenley was also disloyal ;\\n\\n4, I question whether, on the record\\nbefore us, this Court should direct the at-\\ntorney general in the exercise of what,\\nnormally, is considered to be his executive\\ndiscretion.\\n\\nFirst, let me point out that I believe that\\nthe majority has acted in good faith, and\\nthat they sincerely believe, as indeed they\\nfind, that both Henley and BTNB were\\ndisloyal to this trust. I believe, however,\\nthat the majority has made an inflexible\\napplication of the conflict of interest rule,\\nwhich I believe is not suitable in this case.\\nFurthermore, the majority has specifically\\nfailed to apply the principle that the con-\\nduct of fiduciary business by national\\nbanks is governed, significantly, by federal\\nlaws and regulations.\\n\\nThe bank acted in good faith.\\n\\nThe trial judge determined that the bank\\nacted in good faith. There is substantial\\nevidence to support this finding, and I be-\\nlieve that this finding of no disloyalty is\\nvery important to a decision in this case.\\n\\nNobody can quarrel with the fundamen-\\ntal rule of law, stated in the majority opin-\\nion, that a trustee must act in good faith\\nand give undivided loyalty to his trust.\\nFirst National Bank of Birmingham v.\\nBasham, 238 Ala. 500, 191 So. 873 (1939).\\n\\nUnquestionably, if a trustee has engaged\\nin self-dealing, as a matter of public policy,\\nand because of the temptation of wrongdo-\\ning, the cestui que trust (the attorney gen-\\neral represented them in this case) may\\nelect to affirm or disaffirm, unless coun-\\ntervailing equities have —_ intervened.\\nWhether the trust estate sustained a loss\\nor profited is of no consequence. The\\nBasham case also says that the primary\\nconsideration is the good faith of the trus-\\ntee. In Basham, the trial court had sur-\\ncharged the trustee. This Court reversed\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\nand remanded the case, saying at one\\npoint: .\\n\\n“Banks, authorized by law to engage\\nin a trust business, owe the same fideli-\\nty, and are subject to the same rules\\ngoverning individual trustees, when ap-\\nplicable on principle.\\n\\n“A distinction must be drawn between\\ntransactions wherein the interest of the\\nbank and the trusts in its keeping are in\\ncommon, as where the acts of the bank\\nare in aid of such trusts, and transac-\\ntions wherein their interests are antago-\\nnistic. Statutes conferring upon State\\nor National Banks the power to engage\\nin a trust business are designed to make\\navailable to investors the facilities and\\nthe experiences of Bankers in making\\ninvestments, safeguarding the ‘trusts by\\nsetting up trust departments, directly en-\\ngaged in the handling of trusts, and\\nkeeping complete records of trust trans-\\nactions relating to each trust, subject to\\nexamination by the supervising agencies\\nof government.”\\n\\nA close reading of the Basham case indi-\\ncates to me that this Court recognized in\\nthat case that even if a conflict of interest\\nmay seem to exist, the good faith of the\\ntrustee is the critical question.\\n\\nThe majority also cites Barker v. First\\nNational Bank of Birmingham, 20 F.Supp.\\n185 (D.C.Ala.1937), in support of their po-\\nsition that BTNB was disloyal. I believe\\nthe majority has failed to read what this\\nCourt said about the Barker case in Bash-\\nam, as follows:\\n\\n“Such dealings are challenged as viola-\\ntion of the rule of undivided loyalty to\\neach trust. If the trustee has no person-\\nal interest to serve, there is nothing in-\\nherent in such transaction inconsistent\\nwith full loyalty to both; may do both a\\ngood service. We do not concur with\\nthe views expressed in Barker v. First\\nNat. Bank of Birmingham, D.C., 20 F.\\nSupp. 185, 190, to the effect that loyalty\\nto the selling trust in such case demands\\n\\na sale at the highest obtainable price,\\nand loyalty to the buyer demands a pur-\\nchase at the lowest price. One of the\\ncriticisms of participations is that the\\nmarket therefor is limited to the family\\nof trusts. It would be a severe rule to\\ncharge a trustee with a breach of trust\\ntoward the seller where he has obtained\\nthe full amount he would have received\\nif he had collected the loan at the time,\\nor a breach of trust toward the buyer\\nwho gets a good loan on like terms he\\nwould have gotten on a new mortgage,\\nand without the expense of negotiating\\nand closing a new loan.\\n\\n“We concur in the Restatement, supra,\\nto the effect that when challenged as un-\\nfair, resulting in loss to the buyer, the\\nburden is on the trustee to show the\\ntransaction was in good faith, and in the\\nexercise of sound discretion and pru-\\ndence in making this, as any other in-\\nvestment.” (Emphasis added.)\\n\\nIn Barker, the federal district court had\\ncriticized the bank on an inter-trust sale of\\na mortage participation, but did not sur-\\ncharge the trustee which acted in good\\nfaith.\\n\\nI believe that Alabama follows the rule,\\nadvocated by many legal writers, that\\nwhen conflicts of interest cases involving\\ncorporate trustees arise, they should be ap-\\nproached in light of the remoteness of the\\nconflict and the presence or absence of\\ngood faith. see, Prochnow, Conflict of In-\\nterest and the Corporate Trustee, 22 Bus.\\nLaw, 929 (1967); Comments, Corporate\\nTrustee’s Conflict of Interest, 25 U.Chi.L,\\nRev. 382 (1958). The writer of the Uni-\\nversity of Chicago Comment thinks both\\nBasham and Barker suggest “the use of\\ngood faith as a defense” in a conflicts of\\ninterest case. It has also been suggested\\nthat almost every trustee is subject to some\\ndegree of divided loyalty. Niles, The Di-\\nvided Loyalty Rule, 91 Trusts and Estates,\\n734 (1952). Niles states the most common\\ndisloyalty is for a trustee to conduct him-\\n\\n\\n52\\n\\nself so that he can be safe from any criti-\\ncism,\\n\\nThe problem I have with the majority\\nopinion is that I do not think the opinion\\nrecognizes the use of good faith as a de-\\nfense in a conflict of interest case. Even\\nif I did not think that this Court had rec-\\nognized good faith as a defense in a con-\\nflict of interest case, I believe the settlor\\nof this particular trust recognized that, on\\noccasion, one or both of the trustees might\\nhave an “adverse interest.” The only fimi-\\ntation he made was that each trustee\\nshould not exercise any power or discre-\\ntion for the “personal advantage of the\\ntrustees.” The specific trust clause pro-\\nvides :\\n\\n“In the management and control of the\\ntrust estate, the Trustees may (irrespec-\\ntive of the adverse interest of any Trus-\\ntee) do and have done with respect to the\\ntrust estate and every part thereof all\\nthings which in the sole judgment and\\ndiscretion of the Trustees may seem nec-\\nessary, desirable or proper to promote,\\nprotect or conserve the interests thereof\\nand of the beneficiaries thereof, in like\\nmanner as if the Trustees were entitled\\nto said property beneficially, and every\\ndetermination of the Trustees in the con-\\nstruction of powers or in any matter\\nwith respect to which the Trustees may\\nbe empowered to act or exercise discre-\\ntion hereunder, whether made upon a\\nquestion formally or actually raised or\\nimplied in any act or proceeding of the\\nTrustees in relation to the premises,\\nshall be binding upon all persons inter-\\n\\nested in the trust estate and shall not be,\\n\\nobjected to or questioned on any grounds\\nwhatsoever. Powers and discretion,\\nhowever, are vested in the Trustees as\\nfiduciaries in the interest of the trust es-\\ntate and its beneficiaries and not for the\\npersonal advantage of the Trustees.”\\n(Emphasis added.)\\nAs I read this clause, the trustees could\\nact, “irrespective of the adverse interest”\\n\\nof either of them, but they must act in\\n\\ngood faith for the best interest of the\\ntrust. Now, there was a difference of\\nopinion between the co-trustees about\\nwhether the merger was in the best inter-\\nest of the trust. If both trustees acted in\\ngood faith, thinking their independent\\njudgments were in the best interest of the\\ntrust, why is that a breach of trust? Is it\\nnot possible that the bank’s business judg-\\nment concerning what was good for the\\nbank would also be good for the trust, es-\\npecially since a substantial asset in the\\ntrust was the bank stock?\\n\\nIn Basham, this Court seems to approve\\nof transactions where the interests of a\\ntrustee coincides with those of the trust,\\nassuming, of course, the presence of good\\nfaith:\\n\\n“Since the trustee has the clear right\\nto deposit such funds in a good and sol-\\nvent bank, there is no reason, nor legis-\\nlative policy, to require deposit in a bank\\nother than that selected by the settler to\\nhandle trust funds althought the trustee\\nbank, like any other bank, would hold\\nthem as available assets for loans on its\\nown account. See, also, Robinson v.\\nWilliams, Superintendent, 229 Ala. 692,\\n159 So. 239. National Banks are re-\\nquired to deposit securities for the pro-\\ntection of such funds. 12 U.S.C.A. §\\n248(k).\\n\\n“As a business proposition, such depos-\\nits may enable the trustee to do a good\\nservice to the trust estates at less ex-\\npense.\\n\\n“All this is to demonstrate the policy\\nof our laws in disapproving transactions\\nby such trustees where the personal in-\\nterest of the trustee is at variance with\\nthe interest of those whom he represents\\nin trust relations; and to uphold trans-\\nactions in the common interest of the\\ntrustee and trust estates in his keeping.\\nEquity rules are to be applied in recogni-\\ntion of this policy, and deal with reali-\\nties, not matters of form merely.” (Em-\\nphasis added.)\\n\\n\\n| 53\\nbe\\n\\nSince the trial court found the bank was\\nnot disloyal, I believe that this finding, un-\\nder Alabama law and under the terms of\\nthe trust instrument, was a defense against\\nthe “conflict of interest” charge.\\n\\nThe conduct of fiduciary business by a\\nnational bank is governed by\\nfederal law and regulations.\\n\\nUnder the facts of this case, what feder-\\nal law was applicable? Let’s examine the\\nfacts and apply the law. The management\\nof the bank had decided to consolidate.\\nSince the bank held shares of its own stock\\nas trustee, it could not vote the shares in\\nthe consolidation proceeding, because Tit.\\n12, § 61, U.S.C, prohibited it from voting\\nthese trust shares. That section provides,\\nin part:\\n\\n“In all elections of directors, each\\nshareholder shall have the right to vote\\nthe number of shares owned by him for\\nas many persons as there are directors to\\nbe elected, or to cumulate such shares\\nand give one candidate as many votes as\\nthe number of directors multiplied by the\\nnumber of his shares shall equal, or to\\n\\ndistribute them on the same principle -\\n\\namong as many candidates as he shall\\nthink fit; and in deciding all other ques-\\ntions at meetings of shareholders, each\\nshareholder shall be entitled to one vote\\non each share of stock held by him;\\n* * * and (3) shares of its own stock\\nheld by a national bank and one or more\\npersons as trustees may be voted by such\\nother person or persons, as trustees, in\\nthe same manner as if he or they were\\nthe sole trustee. * * * Whenever\\nshares of stock cannot be voted by rea-\\nson of being held by the bank as sole\\ntrustee such shares shall be excluded in\\ndetermining whether matters voted upon\\nby the shareholders were adopted by the\\nrequisite percentage of shares.” (Em-\\nphasis added.)\\n\\nAs I read this statute, when the question\\nof merger came up, this section prohibited\\nthe bank from voting the trust stock.\\n\\nHowever, the statute specifically permitted\\nHenley, as co-trustee, to vote this stock.\\nHenley, acting under this statute, actually\\nvoted every share of the trust stock\\nagainst the merger, as he had a legal right\\nto do acting as he was under the statute\\nas the “sole trustee.” A reading of Tit. 12,\\n§ 61, convinces me that when a national\\nbank holds shares of its own stock as sole\\ntrustee, it cannot vote the stock and these\\nshares are excluded in determining wheth-\\ner matters voted upon by the shareholders\\nwere adopted by the requisite percentage\\nof shares. I believe this portion of Tit. 12,\\n§ 61, U.S.C., was added by Congress to the\\n\\n- National Banking Act in 1966 to prevent\\n\\nan inequity. If shares so held by a bank in\\ntrust could not be voted, and were not ex-\\ncluded, voting rights belonging to the bene-\\nficiaries of the trust would, in effect, be\\ngiven to the remaining shareholders. cf.\\nCleveland Trust Co. v. Eaton, 21 Ohio St.\\n2d 129, 256 N.E.2d 198 (1970). When\\nshares of its own stock are held by a na-\\ntional bank and one or more persons as\\ntrustees, then the other person or persons\\nmay vote the stock in the same manner as\\nif he or they were the sole trustee.\\n\\nHenley, acting as sole trustee, became a\\n\\n‘dissenting shareholder, pursuant to federal\\n\\nlaw. The critical question at this point\\nwas: what duty did the bank have with re-\\ngard to the trust? The majority seems to\\nsay, in effect, that the bank should have\\nsupported Henley’s dissent even though it\\n‘was against its business judgment. I disa-\\ngree. Federal law prohibited the bank\\nfrom voting the stock. Was the bank un-\\nder a duty to support Henley’s dissent,\\neven though it, acting in good faith,\\nthought his dissent was not in the best in-\\nterest of the trust? I think not. If Henley\\nhad not dissented, the BTNB stock would\\nhave been exchanged for the “new” bank\\nstock. Does the bank fail to give undivid-\\ned loyalty to the trust by disagreeing with\\na business judgment exercised by a co-trus-\\ntee, who is statutorily empowered to vote\\nthe shares as a “sole trustee?” I think\\nnot, I believe that federal law sufficiently\\n\\n\\n54 a\\n\\nprotected this trust but even if I did not\\nthink that, I believe that this Court should\\nconsider this case in the light of the find-\\ning by the trial court of an absence of bad\\nfaith on the part of the bank.\\n\\nIn any event, when Henley decided to\\ndissent, I believe that he became a “dissent-\\ning stockholder” under the provisions of\\nfederal law and from that point forward,\\nnational law provided, in detail, the proce-\\ndure which had to be followed to deter-\\nmine the value of the shares. Tit. 12, §\\n215(b), U.S.C., provides, in part, that when\\na shareholder dissents from a plan of con-\\nsolidation, he “shall be entitled to receive\\nthe value of the shares so held by him\\nwhen such consolidation is approved by the\\nComptroller * * *” The valuation of\\nthe shares is governed by national law.\\nTit. 12, § 215(c) provides:\\n\\n“Valuation of Shares\\n\\n“(c) The value of the shares of\\nany dissenting shareholder shall be as-\\ncertained, as of the effective date of\\nthe consolidation, by an appraisal\\nmade by a committee of three persons,\\ncomposed of (1) one selected by the\\nvote of the holders of the majority of\\nthe stock, the owners of which are en-\\ntitled to payment in cash; (2) one se-\\nlected by the directors of the consoli-\\ndated banking association; and (3)\\none selected by the two so selected.\\nThe valuation agreed upon by any two\\nof the three appraisers shall govern.\\nIf the value so fixed shall not be satis-\\nfactory to any dissenting shareholder\\nwho has requested payment, that\\nshareholder may, within five days after\\nbeing notified of the appraised value\\nof his shares, appeal to the Comptrol-\\nler, who shall cause a reappraisal to be\\nmade which shall be final and binding\\nas to the value of the shares of the ap-\\npellant.\\n\\nAppraisal by Comptroller; expenses of\\nconsolidated association; sale and\\nresale of shares; State appraisal and\\nconsolidation law.\\n\\n“(d) If, within ninety days from the\\ndate of consummation of the consoli-\\ndation, for any reason one or more of\\nthe appraisers is not selected as herein\\nprovided, or the appraisers fail to de-\\ntermine the value of such shares, the\\nComptroller shall upon written request\\nof any interested party cause an ap-\\npraisal to be made which shall be final\\nand binding on all parties. The ex-\\npenses of the Comptroller in making\\nthe reappraisal or the appraisal, as the\\ncase may be, shall be paid by the con-\\nsolidated banking association. The\\nvalue of the shares ascertained shall\\nbe promptly paid to the dissenting\\nshareholders by the consolidated bank-\\ning association. Within thirty days\\nafter payment has been made to all\\ndissenting shareholders as provided for\\nin this section the shares of stock of\\nthe consolidated banking association\\nwhich would have been delivered to\\nsuch dissenting shareholders had they\\nnot requested payment shall be sold by\\nthe consolidated banking association at\\nan advertised public auction, unless\\nsome other method of sale is approved\\nby the Comptroller, and the consolidat-\\ned banking association shall have the\\nright to purchase any of such shares\\nat such public auction, if it is the\\nhighest bidder therefor, for the pur-\\npose of reselling such shares within\\nthirty days thereafter to such person\\nor persons and at Such price not less\\nthan par as its board of directors by\\nresolution may determine, If the\\nshares are sold at public auction at a\\nprice greater than the amount paid to\\nthe dissenting shareholders the excess\\nin such sale price shall be paid to such\\nshareholders. The appraisal of such\\n\\nshares of stock in any State bank shall\\nbe determined in the manner pre-\\nscribed by the law of the State in such\\n\\n\\n55\\n\\ncases, rather than as provided in this\\nsection, if such provision is made in\\nthe State law; and no such consolida-\\ntion shall be in contravention of the\\nlaw of the State under which such\\nbank is incorporated. (Emphasis add-\\ned.)\\n\\nAs I read the majority opinion, it does\\nnot say that the bank failed to follow the\\nprocedure outlined in the national banking\\nlaws and regulations. Procedurally,. the\\nbank did nothing that was not allowed un-\\nder national banking laws in consolidation\\nproceedings involving dissenting share-\\nholders. Even Professor Scott, who has\\nbeen accused of developing the stringent\\nconflict of interest rule [see, Notes and\\n\\nComments: Trusts: The Rule of Undivid-\\n\\ned Loyalty—Corporate trustees holding\\ntheir own shares, 33 Cornell LQ. 616\\n(1948), agrees that this is true, He says:\\n\\n“Corporate trustees are subject to\\nmany regulations which are inapplicable\\n\\nto individual trustees. Thus the trust\\ndepartments of state banks and’ trust\\ncompanies are subject to the supervision\\nof the banking authorities of the state.\\nFrequently there is legislation regulating\\nthe duties of corporate trustees and the\\nmethod of their conduct of trust busi-\\nness. The conduct of fiduciary business\\nby national banks is governed by the\\nFederal Reserve Act, § 11(k), and by\\nRegulations issued in pursuance of the\\nAct. Regulation F of the Board of Gov-\\nernors of the Federal Reserve system is\\nnow superseded by Regulation 9 of the\\nComptroller of the Currency.\\n\\n“Although a state which permits trust\\ncompanies or banks to act as fiduciaries\\ncannot prevent national banks within the\\nstate from exercising fiduciary powers, a\\nnational bank acting as trustee is subject\\nto the laws of the state, except insofar\\nas these laws may conflict with federal\\nlaws or regulations or interfere with the\\npurpose of Congress in permitting na-\\ntional banks to exercise fiduciary pow-\\n\\ners.\\n\\nOf course, federal law would not protect\\nself-dealing, and for that matter, neither\\nwould Alabama law, where the personal in-\\nterest of a trustee is at variance with the\\ninterest of those whom he represents in\\ntrust relations. As I read the federal law,\\nit is designed to prevent conflicts of inter-\\nest when a bank trustee holds shares of its\\nown stock in trust. I believe that a trustee\\nbank which follows federal regulations, in\\ngood faith, could not be guilty of a breach\\nof trust. In other words, when a national\\nbank acts pursuant to federal law in merg-\\ner proceedings, without disloyalty to the\\ntrust, as the trial court found in this case,\\nthen I believe that this Court could not re-\\nmove a national bank as trustee so long as\\nit was acting in good faith in following\\nfederal laws and regulations. [cf. First\\nNational Bank v. Fellows, 244 U.S. 416, 37\\nS.Ct. 734, 61 L.Ed. 1233 (1917)]\\n\\nCourt decides question not raised.\\n\\nI believe the Court exceeds its appellate\\njurisdiction when it decides that Henley\\nwas also disloyal. The trial court entered\\nno judgment on this issue. In the absence\\nof a finding of bad faith by the trial court,\\nI would not reach this issue. This Court’s\\nfinding of disloyalty by Henley raises seri-\\nous questions. Could the Attorney Gener-\\nal, or should he, in view of the suggestion\\ngiven in the majority opinion that he\\nshould actively participate, file proceedings\\nagainst Henley for surcharge?\\n\\nTt appears to me that Henley, under the\\ntrust instrument, had the same powers and\\nduties BTNB had. I would apply the same\\nprinciples of law to Henley’s actions as I\\nwould to BINB’s—that is, if that were be-\\nfore me. I believe that with regard to the\\npurchase by the trust of the Birmingham\\nRealty Company stock, the trial court has\\nnot found BTNB disloyal. The trial judge\\nmade no finding with regard to whether\\nHenley was acting in good faith and in the\\nbest interest of the trust or for his own\\npersonal advantage in this matter. I fail\\nto find in the record before us that Henley’s\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\nloyalty was made an issue at the trial level.\\nConsequently, I fail to see how this Court\\ncan reach it, Furthermore, to find Henley\\nguilty of a breach of trust without allowing\\nhim an opportunity to defend raises serious\\ndue process questions.\\n\\nThis Court cannot direct the exercise of an\\nact of executive discretion.\\n\\nThe attorney general appeared in this\\nproceeding, at the beginning of the trial\\nwith three attorneys, but took little active\\ninterest except to ask the court to protect\\nthe beneficiaries of the trust. I question\\nwhether this Court should suggest to the\\nAttorney General how he must represent\\nthe beneficiaries of this trust. He is a\\nconstitutional officer and is vested with\\nexecutive discretion,\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe effect of the majority decision, I\\nfear, means that every bank which is serv-\\ning as a sole trustee or as a co-trustee of a\\ntrust containing shares of its own stock,\\nwould have to, at least temporarily, remove\\nitself during the course of every consolida-\\ntion proceeding. I cannot believe this is\\nthe law. In short, I think the matter of\\nself-dealing and consolidation, are dealt\\nwith by federal law and by regulations\\npromulgated by the comptroller of the cur-\\nrency, See, 12 C.F.R, § 9.12. I believe\\nthat when a trustee bank acts in good\\nfaith, and follows the procedures required\\nby federal law, this Court should not find\\nthat the trustee bank breached its duty. In\\nother words, it would seem to me that\\nwhen an individual co-trustee decides to\\nexercise rights granted to him by federal\\nlaw “in a manner as if he or they were the\\nsole trustee,” the co-trustee, acting as the\\nsole trustee, must bear the commensurate\\nresponsibilities of a sole trustee. If the\\nbank had been sole trustee, the bank shares\\nwould have been excluded in determining\\nwhether the other shareholders voted for\\nor against merger by the required percent-\\nage.\\n\\nThe principles I would apply would\\nseem to be especially true in this case,\\nsince we are dealing with a charitable\\ntrust. Section 383, Restatement of Trusts\\n2d, provides that if there are several trust-\\nees of a charitable trust, the powers con-\\nferred on them can properly be exercised\\nby a majority of the trustees, unless it is\\notherwise provided by the terms of the\\ntrust. In other words, in this case, federal\\nlaw permitted the co-trustee of this chari-\\ntable trust to exercise the powers which\\nhad been initially conferred upon the co-\\ntrustees. Henley decided to dissent from\\nthe merger. I cannot say whether his\\njudgment was good or bad. I do believe,\\nhowever, that under the trust instrument in\\nthis case, both trustees had the power and\\ndiscretion to act, irrespective of their ad-\\nverse interests, so long as they exercised\\ntheir powers and discretions in the best in-\\nterest of the trust. First National Bank of\\nBirmingham v. Basham, supra.\\n\\nWhen Henley dissented and the bank\\nwas put in a conflict of interest position,\\nunder federal law, Alabama law, and the\\nterms of the trust instrument, the bank had\\nto exercise good faith, The trial court\\nfound the bank was not disloyal, as a mat-\\nter of fact.\\n\\nIn view of the above, I would affirm the\\njudgment of the trial court which found\\nthat the bank was not disloyal to the trust.\\n\\nHEFLIN, Chief Justice (dissenting) :\\n\\nWhile I don’t completely agree with all\\nthe language and all of the conclusions of\\nlaw contained in Justice Maddox’ -dissent-\\ning opinion, I am in general agreement\\nwith it.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the Congress of the Unit-\\n\\ned States anticipated the problems which\\narose in this case. Congress anticipated\\n\\nthat conflicts of interest could easily arise\\nbetween a bank trustee and an individual\\nco-trustee and that charges and counter-\\ncharges of disloyalty to the trust and its\\nbeneficiaries could be present in a merger\\n\\n\\n57\\n\\nreorganization of a national bank where\\nthe trust held stock in that bank. There-\\nfore, Congress provided procedures to meet\\nthe anticipated problems, including the val-\\nuation of bank stock held by a trust of\\nwhich the merging bank was one of the\\ntrustees.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the majority opinion I\\nhave concluded that the majority finds that\\nthe only real breach of BTNB’s trust du-\\nties involved in the merger reorganization\\nwas that BTNB breached its fiduciary re-\\nlationship in failing to submit valuation\\ndata to the Comptroller of the Currency.\\nSince an appraisal was made by the comp-\\ntroller and public auctions of the stock\\nwere held, strict compliance with the re-\\nquirements concerning the appointment of\\nthe three appraisers and with other prelim-\\ninary steps was made moot. My colleagues\\nof the majority fail to realize that Con-\\ngress placed a duty on the comptroller to\\nmake the appraisal of the value of the\\nstock. The choice of the comptroller to\\nmake the appraisal was not by chance.\\nWho else other than the comptroller would\\nhave access to all of the records of the\\nbank and the authority to demand and ac-\\nquire information which might affect val-\\nuations?\\n\\nIn my judgment, Congress intended that\\nthe federal law would preempt the state\\nlaw as to the details and the procedure of\\na merger of a national bank, including the\\nprocedure of determining the value of the\\nstock of a dissenting trust of which the\\nmerging bank was one of the trustees. If\\nnot, why did Congress specify such a de-\\ntailed and protective procedure? See\\nRogers v. First National Bank of St.\\nGeorge, 297 F.Supp. 641 (D.S.C.), aff\\'d\\n410 F.2d 579 (4th Cir. 1969),\\n\\nThe majority cites one other breach of\\nthe bank-trustee’s responsibility—the fail-\\nure to buy stock in a corporation when the\\nindividual co-trustee recommends the pur-\\nchase.\\n\\nThe bank in this instance gave many\\nvalid reasons why stock in the Birmingham\\nRealty Company should not be purchased.\\n\\nThe trial court heard the evidence ore ten-\\nus. I do not find from the evidence that\\nthe decision of the trial court was plainly\\nerroneous or manifestly unjust. Kubiszyn\\nv. Bradley, 292 Ala. 570, 298 So.2d 9\\n(1974). In Dougherty v. Gulf Shores Mo-\\ntel, 292 Ala, 252, 254, 292 So.2d 454, 456\\n(1974), this court said:\\n\\n“Where the evidence is heard orally\\nbefore the trial court, the finding of the\\ncourt has the effect of a jury’s verdict\\nand will not be disturbed on appeal un-\\nless plainly erroneous, And we must af-\\nfirm the trial court’s decree if fairly\\nsupported by credible evidence under any\\nreasonable aspect, regardless of what\\nmight be our view of the evidence. Lott\\nv. Keith, 286 Ala. 431, 241 So.2d 104;\\nNorton v, Norton, 280 Ala. 307, 193 So.\\n2d 750.”\\n\\nIt is difficult to understand how the ma-\\njority of this court can reach the issue of\\na breach of trust duties by John C. Henley,\\nII, the individual co-trustee. The trial\\ncourt didn’t mention any such breach in its\\ndecree. There is no urging by cross appeal\\nor otherwise from any party to this cause\\nthat this court should make such a finding.\\n\\nI am in agreement with Justice Maddox\\nin his treatment of the Attorney General\\nissue.\\n\\nI would affirm the decree of the trial\\ncourt.\\n\\nON REHEARING\\n\\nJONES, Justice.\\nOpinion corrected.\\n\\nApplication for rehearing overruled.\\n\\nMERRILL, ALMON, and EMBRY, JJ.,\\n\\nconcur.\\nSHORES, J., concurs in the result.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Adams, initially filed\\nan action in the nature of ejectment\\nagainst the then defendant, Jack Cantrell.\\nHis complaint stated that he “sues to re-\\n\\n\\n60 Le\\n\\ncover possession of the following tract of\\nland” (describing it as containing approxi-\\nmately 0.87 of an acre). Cantrell demand-\\ned an abstract pursuant to Tit. 7, § 940,\\nand filed a demurrer to the complaint on\\nMay 3, 1973. (This was prior to the ef-\\nfective date of ARCP, July 3, 1973.) On\\nMay 28, 1974, Cantrell informed the court\\nthat he had conveyed the property to\\nJames L. Cooper and moved that Cooper\\nbe substituted as defendant. The motion\\nwas granted.\\n\\nOn June 10, 1974, Cooper moved for a\\nsummary judgment and Adams countered\\nby dismissing his ejectment count and he\\namended by adding the statutory bill to\\nquiet title. An order granting the motion\\nwas rendered September 26, 1974.\\n\\nThe next action shown by the record\\nwas a second motion by defendant Cooper\\nfor summary judgment. Cooper attached\\nan affidavit of his father, James K. Coop-\\ner. The father stated that he purchased\\nthe property for his son from one A. E.\\nSpeed in 1960, that his son went into pos-\\nsession and rented a tin building, which\\nSpeed had built on the property, to various\\ntenants until his son sold the property to\\nJack Cantrell in 1971; that Cantrell went\\ninto possession. until he sold the property\\nback to Cooper’s son on August 10, 1973;\\nthat during Cantrell’s ownership, Cantrell\\n“Gmproved the tin building and made it into\\na 3 room house and garage and made it his\\nresidence. After buying said property\\nback from Jack Cantrell, I immediately\\nwent back into possession of said property\\non behalf of my son and I have been in\\ncontinuous possession of same since then to\\nthe present time, renting same to various\\ntenants on behalf of my son.”\\n\\nThis was all and the only testimony in\\nthe record as to possession,\\n\\nThe next action shown in the record is\\nthe judgment of the trial court. Even\\nthough defendant Cooper made the motion\\nfor summary judgment, the judgment was\\n\\nentered for the plaintiff Adams. It is dat-\\ned March 25, 1975 and reads:\\n\\n“This cause coming on to be heard on\\nthe motion for summary judgment, argu-\\nment of counsel, various exhibits, and af-\\nfidavits by various parties, and the Court\\nhaving heard and considered same is of\\nthe opinion that the Plaintiff is the own-\\ner in fee simple of the property de-\\nscribed in the Bill of Complaint.\\n\\n“In accordance with the motions here-\\ntofore filed, the Plaintiff is the owner of\\nthe land described herein in fee simple.”\\n\\nHl Under a bill to quiet title pursuant\\nto the statute, Tit. 7, § 1109, Code 1940,\\n“the complainant must have the quiet and\\npeaceable possession, actual or construc-\\ntive, as distinguished from a contested,\\nscrambling or disputed possession.” Mot-\\nley v. Crumpton, 265 Ala. 565, 93 So,2d\\n413; Ford v.

If he cannot,\\nhe fails to recover and his suit cannot be\\nmaintained. But that does not mean that\\nthe equity court suddenly lost jurisdic-\\ntion to proceed any further. * * *’”\\n\\nHere, the complaint alleged the jurisdic-\\ntional allegation of peaceable possession in\\nparagraph 3 of the complaint, but he of-\\nfered no proof and made no move from\\nthe date of the filing of defendant’s affi-\\ndavit on Jan. 23, 1975 to the entering of\\nthe decree on March 25, 1975 to dispute\\nthe proof of peaceable possession by de-\\nfendant.\\n\\n\\nA paragraph in Palmer v. Rucker, 289\\nAla, 496, 268 So.2d 773, is applicable here:\\n\\n“There is undisputed testimony suffi-\\ncient to show actual possession by the\\nappellants at the time that suit was insti-\\ntuted.”\\n\\nHI Since the plaintiff did not meet the\\nburden of proving his allegations, there\\nwas no proof to support the judgment of\\nthe court and it must be reversed.\\n\\nHH In brief on appeal, counsel for Ad-\\nams includes an abstract as an exhibit, but\\nthe abstract is not in the record before us;\\n\\nand shortly before oral argument, an affi-.\\n\\ndavit of the trial court was filed and that\\nthis exhibit “was both read and considered\\nby me in the decision of this case.”\\n\\n‘These matters, being dehors the record,\\ncannot be considered.

Harris, in a malpractice suit,\\nin the Jefferson County Circuit Court,\\nBessemer Division,\\n\\nThe principal issues are: (1) Did Mrs,\\nHarris prove her case without expert med-\\nical evidence of community standards of\\nskill, care, and diligence. (2) Was it error\\nto permit testimony referring to Lloyd No-\\nland’s insurance coverage. (3) Did the\\ntrial court err in charging the jury, and\\n(4) were the damages excessive.\\n\\nMrs. Harris, a 53-year-old woman, filed\\na damage suit against Lloyd Noland, for\\nnegligently applying a hot plaster cast on\\nher leg. Her claim is based on the follow-\\ning facts.\\n\\nMrs. Harris fell while sweeping the back\\ndoor steps of her home. She was taken to\\na\\n\\n65\\n\\nLloyd Noland’s emergency room for X~-\\nray, where a fracture of her left knee was\\ndiagnosed. Following X-ray, a splint cast\\nwas applied to her leg by a Lloyd Noland\\ntechnician to immobilize it until treatment\\nof the fracture. While he was applying\\nthe cast, Mrs. Harris told him that her leg\\nwas burning near the calf. He poured\\ncold water into the cast and the burning\\neased, Subsequently, the cast was re-\\nmoved, the fracture was treated, and the\\nleg was placed in traction,\\n\\nOn one of her rounds, a nurse observed\\n‘a wound on Mrs, Harris’ leg. The wound,\\napparently resulting from the plaster burn,\\nbecame the concern of the nurses, and\\nMrs. Harris’ husband, who discussed it\\nwith a staff doctor.\\n\\nThe wound was treated while Mrs. Har-\\nris remained at Lloyd Noland, and after\\nher discharge, she received out-patient\\ntreatment for it.\\n\\nPrior to her discharge, a cylinder cast\\nwas applied to Mrs. Harris’ injured leg by\\na staff doctor. On one occasion, after re-\\nturning home, Mrs. Harris noticed a strong\\nodor about the place of the wound. And,\\nwhen she went back for treatment as an\\nout-patient, she told a staff doctor about\\nthe odor. The cast was ventilated and a\\nblack, bloody gauze was removed. The\\nwound was cleaned and dressed. At this\\ntime, the doctor told Mrs. Harris that she\\nmight have to have a skin graft. She ob-\\njected, and-no grafting was done. She has\\na scar on her leg about 8 X 12 centimeters\\nin size.\\n\\nI\\n\\nLloyd Noland contends that because of\\nMrs. Harris’ failure to introduce expert\\nmedical testimony that it, or its employees,\\nfailed to exercise that degree of skill, care,\\nand diligence as other hospitals within the\\nsame community would have exercised in\\nlike cases, she did not prove a prima facie\\ncase.\\n\\n66\\n\\nThe testimony of two doctors was intro-\\nduced by Mrs. Harris. One doctor testi-\\n\\nfied “. I don’t know what caused\\nthis lady’s burn. I had never seen this\\nhappen before . . .” Another testified,\\n\\n“Well, I would say that the tissue perhaps\\nhad some ability [sic—should read disabil-\\nity] or was the result of an injury or as\\nthe result of a direct blow, as a result of\\nperhaps some increase in the tissue sensi-\\ntivity of the local area, There are so\\nmany reasons to mention without saying\\nthis is it, many ways you can get an area\\nlike that.” On cross-examination, this doc-\\ntor said, “. I cannot be sure one\\nway or the other. I assume that there are\\nseveral possibilities. She could, have had\\nincreased local heat, a scrape or a direct\\nblow, no way of telling for sure.”\\n\\nMr. Kimbrough, who has been putting\\non splints for over 18 years testified as an\\nexpert for Lloyd Noland and said, “I have\\nnever seen it [referring to the cause of the\\nwound on Mrs. Harris’ leg] happen before\\nand I couldn’t understand how it could\\nhave happened.” He testified further that\\nhe put the splint on Mrs. Harris’ leg the\\nsame way that he had put splints on thou-\\nsands of other persons.\\n\\nI In this case, we are of the opinion\\nthat no medical evidence of failure to ex-\\nercise that degree of skill, care and dili-\\ngence as other hospitals within the same\\ncommunity would have exercised in like\\ncases, is not fatal to Mrs. Harris’ case.\\nOrdinarily, in a malpractice case, proof of\\nwhat is or is not proper practice, treat-\\nment, and procedure can be established\\nonly by medical evidence. But, in a case\\nwhere want of skill or lack of care is so\\napparent so as to be understood by a lay-\\nman, and requires only common knowledge\\nand experience to understand it, expert ev-\\nidence is not required. Parrish v. Spink,\\n284 Ala. 263, 224 So.2d 621 (1969).\\n\\nHl Here, no person at the hospital can\\nexplain what happened, yet something did\\nhappen. It does not require an expert to\\n\\nprove a hot object will burn human skin,\\nMrs. Harris testified she was burned, and\\nmedical personnel at Lloyd Noland testi-\\nfied Mrs. Harris’ leg was burned. The ap-\\nplication of the cast causing the burn was\\nwithin the exclusive control of Lloyd No-\\n\\n-land, and Mrs. Harris did not contribute to\\n\\nher injury; consequently, there was no\\nneed for medical evidence. The case was\\nproperly submitted to the jury for its deci-\\nsion. Norwood Hospital v. Brown, 219\\nAla, 445, 122 So. 411 (1929).\\n\\nIL\\n\\nLloyd Noland says the trial court erred\\nby permitting reference to insurance dur-\\ning the direct examination of Mr. Harris\\nas a witness for Mrs. Harris. The error\\nallegedly arises from these questions and\\nanswers:\\n\\n“Q. What did you tell him, if any-\\nthing?\\n\\n“A, I told him we needed compensation\\non it,\\n\\n“Q. On the burns to your wife’s leg?\\n\\n“A, Yes, sir,\\n\\n“Q. What did he reply?\\n\\n“A, He said he’d notify the insurance,\\n\\n“Q. Did you hear from anyone else\\nduring that period?\\n\\n“A, No, sir.\\n\\n“Q. After you talked with Mr. McClain\\nat the hospital, did you talk with\\nanyone else at the hospital?\\n\\n“A, No, I didn’t.\\n\\n“Q. Did you ever talk with Dr. Ham-\\nrick?\\n\\n“A, Over the phone.\\n\\n“Q. Did you call him or did he call you?\\n\\n“A, I believe my wife called him first\\n\\n. and he called back and I talked\\n, to him.\\n\\n\\n“Q. What did Dr. Hamrick tell you,\\nif anything?\\n\\n“A. He said if I would turn it over to\\nthe insurance, they would pay for\\nit.\\n\\n“MR. KNIGHT: I\\'m going to object\\n\\nto that as an unresponsive answer,\\nand move to exclude it. I\\'ll ask the\\nCourt to instruct the jury about cover-\\nage comments,\\n\\n“THE COURT: [I\\'ll sustain the objec-\\ntion, You must not consider that an-\\nswer to that question.”\\n\\nHI When insurance is injected into a\\ncase by irresponsive testimony to a proper\\nquestion, the prejudicial effect of such evi-\\ndence may be eradicated by proper instruc-\\ntions from the court. Cannon v. Scarbor-\\nough, 223 Ala. 674, 137 So. 900 (1931);\\nClark v. Hudson, 265 Ala. 630, 93 So.2d\\n138 (1957).\\n\\nHl Here, the court sustained the objec-\\ntion, and told the jurors they could not\\nconsider the answer to the question, We\\nare of the opinion the prejudice, if any,\\nwas eradicated by the court’s admonition\\nnot to consider the answer. We note in\\npassing, counsel for Lloyd Noland injected\\ninsurance into the case on cross-examina-\\ntion of this witness. It would appear, as\\ncounsel for Mrs. Harris says in brief,\\n“What\\'s good for the goose is good for the\\ngander.”\\n\\nTI.\\n\\nLloyd Noland excepted to that portion of\\nthe court’s oral charge defining standard\\nof care owed by hospitals to their patients.\\nThe court said this:\\n\\n“Tf the defendant in this case followed\\nthe processes that are generally followed\\nand persisted in other well regulated and\\nskilled hospitals in the general area, then\\nhe would not be guilty of negligence. A\\ngood example would be, if a plumber\\n\\n67\\n\\ncame to your house to fix a leak or any\\ndefect, if he did it in the same careful\\nmanner that any other skilled plumber\\nwould have done and something hap-\\npened and your water heater blew up,\\nunless he did something that another\\nskillful plumber would not have done, or\\nwould have done under the same or simi-\\nlar circumstances, he would hardly be re-\\nsponsible for the result of your water\\nheater blowing up.\\n\\n“So, if you\\'re reasonably satisfied\\nfrom the evidence on this occasion that\\nO’Neal Kimbrough applied this appliance\\nwith the same degree of care as other\\ncasts men who are reasonably skilled in\\nanother well regulated hospital would\\nhave done, then he could not be said to\\nhave been guilty of any negligence on\\nthis occasion.”\\n\\nHH Generally stated, the degree of\\ncare, skill, and diligence, owed by a hospi-\\ntal to its patients, is measured by the care,\\nskill, and diligence used generally by hospi-\\ntals in the same community. Doctors Hos-\\npital of Mobile, Inc. v. Kirksey, 290 Ala.\\n220, 275 So.2d 651 (1973). We are of the\\nopinion that the words used by the court in\\nhis instruction, informed the jury of the\\nstandard care a hospital owes to its pa-\\ntients. The judge’s charge was earthy, but\\nthe message to the jury is clear. There is\\nno fixed formula for instructions.

Defendant went\\ninto possession under his certificate of sale\\non December 2, 1964, and claims continu-\\n\\nous possession of the tracts since that date.\\nAbout 1968, he placed a chain link fence\\naround part of the property. He has had\\nit surveyed. During the year 1967, 1968,\\nor 1969, he put a sewage line over part of\\nthe property. Defendant has planted a\\ngarden and shrubbery on the tracts, cleared\\nbrush, and mowed grassy areas. He placed\\na driveway across part of the property.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the evidence, the\\ntrial judge directed a verdict for the de-\\nfendant on the authority of Tit. 51, § 295,\\nCode of Alabama 1940.\\n\\nOn this appeal, plaintiffs urge that the\\ntrial court erred to a reversal in directing\\na verdict for defendant. They contend\\nthat Tit. 51, § 295 (the so-called “short\\nstatute of limitations”) does not begin to\\nrun until the purchaser is shown to have\\nbeen in adverse possession and has become\\nentitled to demand a deed to the tracts.\\nPlaintiffs say the issue of adverse posses-\\nsion should have been submitted to the\\njury.\\n\\nDefendant contends that the undisputed\\ntestimony is that he has been in adverse\\npossession of the tracts since the date of\\nthe tax.sale. He claims that plaintiffs\\nhave paid no taxes and have not offered\\nany evidence of their possession. He thus\\nmaintains that there was nothing to submit\\nto the jury and that under Tit. 51, § 295,\\nhe was entitled to recover.\\n\\nTit. 51, § 295, supra, provides:\\n\\n“No action for the recovery of real es-\\ntate sold for the payment of taxes shall\\nlie unless the same is brought within\\nthree years from the date when the pur-\\nchaser became entitled to demand a deed\\ntherefor; but if the owner of such real\\nestate was, at the time of such sale, un-\\nder the age of twenty-one years, or in-\\nsane, he, his heirs or legal representa-\\ntives, shall be allowed one year after\\nsuch disability is removed to bring suit\\nfor the recovery thereof; but this sec-\\ntion shall not apply to any action\\nbrought by the state; nor to cases in\\n\\n\\n70\\n\\nwhich the owner of the real estate sold\\nhad paid the taxes, for the payment of\\nwhich such real estate was sold, prior to\\nsuch sale; nor shall they apply to cases\\nin which the: real estate sold was not, at\\nthe time of the assessment, or of the\\nsale, subject to taxation.”\\n\\nHI Under this statute, our cases have\\nheld that three years of continuous adverse\\npossession of the lands by the tax sale pur-\\nchaser, measured from the date that he be-\\ncomes entitled to demand a tax deed there-\\nto, will bar an action by the former owner\\nexcept in those instances mentioned in the\\nstatute. (The exceptions are inapplicable\\nhere.) Turnham v. Potter, 289 Ala. 685,\\n271 So.2d 246 (1972).\\n\\nThe record in this case is devoid of evi-\\ndence showing that plaintiffs possessed any\\npart of the lands after the tax sale to de-\\nfendant nor does the record show that\\nplaintiffs have paid any taxes on the\\ntracts.\\n\\nHE (0n the other hand, the evidence is\\nundisputed that defendant (who resided on\\nhis home place between the two tracts)\\nwent into possession under his certificate\\nof sale in 1964, placed a fence on part of\\nthe property, had it surveyed, put a sewage\\nline over part of it, planted a garden and\\nshrubbery, cleared brush, mowed grassy\\nareas, and put a driveway over a portion\\nof the property. Defendant became enti-\\ntled to demand a deed therefor in 1967 un-\\nder the provisions of Tit. 51, § 276. Thus,\\ndefendant completed three years of contin-\\nuous, adverse possession in 1970, Plain-\\ntiffs did not file suit until June 4, 1974.\\nConsequently, plaintiffs’ action was barred\\nby the provisions of Tit. 51, § 295, supra.\\n\\nHI Moreover, ejectment is a possesso-\\nry action, Salter v. Fox, 191 Ala. 34, 67\\nSo. 1006 (1915). In order for plaintiffs to\\nrecover, they must show their right to pos-\\nsession at the time suit was instituted.\\nSalter v.

Appellants are tele-\\nphone service subscribers of General Tele-\\nphone, appellee here. The subscriber class\\nis represented by Crum Foshee. We af-\\nfirm.\\n\\nThe sole issue for decision is whether\\nthe subscribers could prove any set of facts\\nin support of their claim which would enti-\\n\\n\\n72\\n\\ntle them to relief under any cognizable the-\\nory of law. ARCP 12(b) (6).\\n\\nOn 30 October 1972 the Alabama Public\\nService Commission granted General Tele-\\nphone a rate increase. The State of Ala-\\nbama, the Governor and sixteen municipal-\\nities appealed from the order of the Com-\\nmission. On 1 February 1974 the Mont-\\ngomery County Circuit Court ruled that\\nthe APSC established rate was excessive\\nby $208,924 because of errors made by the\\nAPSC in computing General Telephone’s\\nrate base. That court remanded the case\\nto the APSC to enter an order establishing\\nproper rates. That court also ruled it\\ncould not order a refund to subscribers for\\nthe excessive charges paid while the origi-\\nnal APSC order was in effect. This court\\naffirmed, State v. Alabama Public Service\\nCommission, Ala., 307 So.2d 521 (1975),\\nholding the APSC established rate was ex-\\ncessive but that no refund was due because\\nno supersedeas bond was made and no stat~\\nutory authority existed that would permit\\nthe court to order a refund.\\n\\nSubsequently the subscribers brought this\\nclass action seeking to recover charges’\\npaid by them during the time the original\\nAPSC order was in effect in excess of the\\nrates fixed by APSC on remand to it.\\nThe complaint alleged ‘and plaintiffs argue\\nhere that cognizable theories of unjust en-\\nrichment, money had and received, or debt\\nowed empower the courts to grant them re-\\nlief on their claim. The trial court grant-\\ned General Telephone’s motion to dismiss.\\n\\nWe first note this is not a rate case.\\nNor is it a case seeking to\\'recover monies\\npaid for charges in excess of rates estab-\\nlished by the APSC. This case is one in\\nwhich recovery is sought of a portion of\\ncharges paid under a rate schedule estab-\\nlished by lawful order of the APSC.\\n\\nHME The essence of the theories of\\nunjust enrichment or money had and re-\\nceived is that facts can be proved which\\nshow that defendant holds money which in\\nequity and good conscience belongs to\\n\\nplaintiff or was improperly paid to the de-\\nfendant because of mistake or fraud.\\nWash v. Hunt, 281 Ala. 368, 202 So.2d 730\\n(1967); Birmingham Broadcasting Co, v.\\nBell, 259 Ala. 656, 68 So.2d 314 (1953).\\nThe essence of the cause of action for debt\\nis that facts can be proved which shows\\nthe defendant is obligated to pay the com-\\nplainant a liquidated sum of money. Dren-\\nnen Motor Car Co. v. Evans, 192 Ala. 150,\\n68 So. 303 (1915). Thus, in order to pre-\\nvail under these theories of law, a plaintiff\\nmust show that the defendant is legally or\\nequitably obligated to pay money to plain-\\ntiff,\\n\\nHH Code of Ala., Tit. 48, §§ 104, 114,\\nestablishes that there can be but one lawful\\nrate. Moreover under these statutes a reg-\\nulated public utility can charge only the\\nrate established by the APSC. Until the\\nAPSC on remand modified their rate\\nschedule pursuant to order of the circuit\\ncourt, General Telephone could charge and\\ncollect no other rate except that established\\nby the APSC in its order of 30 October\\n1972, Hence it is clear that General Tele-\\nphone is under no legal or equitable obliga-\\ntion to refund any money to their subscrib-\\ners since it did only what it was required\\nto do by statute.\\n\\nHM it is clear that the subscribers\\ncould not prove any set of facts which\\nwould entitle them to relief on a claim for\\na refund of monies paid pursuant to a rate\\nschedule established by a lawful order of\\nthe APSC. There is no common law or\\nequitable remedy for the recovery of\\ncharges prescribed by an order of the\\nAPSC. State v, Alabama Public Service\\nCommission, supra; Adams v.

William Gladden, Jr, Birmingham,:\\nfor appellant.\\n\\nMADDOX, Justice.\\n\\nThe only issue presented’ on this appeal\\ninvolves the irregularity of a jury verdict,\\n\\nWhen the jury foreman announced the\\nverdict to the court, in this negligence ac-\\ntion, he stated it as “$45,000.” On the ver-\\ndict form, however, the amount was shown\\nas “$4,500.”\\n\\nThe jury concluded its deliberations at\\n9:50 a.m., when the foreman read the ver-\\ndict as $45,000. The jury was requested to\\nremain in the courtroom so they could be\\nqualified in another case. One member\\nwas excused for the remainder of the day.\\nThe trial judge discovered, within twenty\\nminutes, the inconsistency between the ver-\\ndict as read by the foreman and the verdict\\nas written, He reassembled the jury, in-\\ncluding the one member who had gone\\nhome, and explained the inconsistency and\\nasked the jury to return to the jury room,\\n\\n\\nand “correct your verdict.” The jury\\n\\nstayed in the jury room approximately\\nCRaintyy and acre tev cham age\\n\\na\\n\\nAs is apparent, the foreman wrote\\n“void” over the “$4,500” sum and initialed\\nit, and entered “$45,000” and initialed that.\\n\\nThe trial judge entered a judgment upon\\nthe jury verdict for $45,000,\\n\\nThe Power Company argues:\\n\\n1. There was a discharge of the jury\\nprior to the activity in court leading to the\\nentry of judgment.\\n\\n2. The judgment(s) of the’ court were\\nbased upon the second deliberation of the\\njury.\\n\\n3. There was no acceptance by the\\ncourt of the oral declaration of the jury as\\na verdict.\\n\\n4, The court had no further authority\\nto reassemble the jury and aliow its rede-\\nliberation upon having noted the disparity\\nbetween the announcement and the written\\nverdict.\\n\\n5. The court did not attempt to correct\\nor amend the original verdict of the jury,\\n\\nthree minutes and returned the following\\nverdict:\\n\\noo\\n\\nFa eta)\\n\\nbut apparently rejected the first finding\\nand announcement by the jury entirely and\\nordered a redeliberation of the case by the\\njury.\\n\\nThis case is one of first impression, on\\nthe exact point involved.\\n\\nWe could discuss at length, whether the\\noral verdict was true, whether the jury\\nwas discharged and therefore could not be\\nreassembled, and other points regarding\\njury verdicts, but we consider it unneces-\\nsary to do so. It is obvious from what\\ntranspired in this case that the $4,500 sum\\nentered on the written verdict was a cleri-\\ncal error. Rule 60(a), ARCP, provides:\\n\\n“Clerical Mistakes. Clerical mistakes\\nin judgments, orders, or other parts of\\nthe record and errors therein arising\\nfrom oversight or omission may be cor-\\nrected by the court at any time of its\\nown initiative or on the motion of any\\nparty and after such notice, if any, as\\nthe court orders.

St. Clair v. Caldwell & Riddle, 72\\nAla, 527 (1882). It can be general or spe-\\ncial. Rule 49, ARCP.\\n\\nHt is abundantly clear that the gen-\\neral verdict of the jury in this case was in\\nfavor of the plaintiff and for the sum of\\n$45,000.

Longshore, Birmingham, for\\n\\nP\\nft\\nS\\n&\\n|\\n\\n\\nJohn Martin Galese, Birmingham, for ap-\\npellee.\\n\\nMADDOX, Justice.\\n\\nThe issue in this case is whether a form-\\ner member of a government employees’ un-\\nion was eligible for membership in the un-\\nion as a “retired” member.\\n\\nCarl Chamblee was a civil service em-\\nployee with the United States government\\nfor several years. He was a member of\\nLocal #2206, American Federation of Gov-\\nernment Employees, during part of this\\ntime. Chamblee left his government em-\\nployment. Whether he “resigned” or “re-\\ntired” is the basic dispute between him and\\nhis union. Chamblee was dropped from\\nthe membership rolls of the union. He\\nsued the union and several of its officers,\\nclaiming that he was eligible for member-\\nship as “retired.” He also asked for dam-\\nages, The trial court found in his favor.\\nThe union appeals, claiming:\\n\\n(1) Chamblee resigned from the federal\\nservice.\\n\\n(2) Chamblee was not eligible to “retire”\\nfrom the federal service.\\n\\n(3) That “resign” and “retire” are not\\nsynonymous terms in the federal system\\nand that the union follows this distinction\\nin its membership and eligibility rules, and\\n\\n(4) No “resigned” employee has ever\\nheld membership in Local #2206.\\n\\n\\n78 Ee\\n\\nHs The union conterids that it had the\\nright, as a voluntary association, to make\\nits own rules and regulations governing\\n\\neligibility for membership, and that a mem- |\\n\\nber of a voluntary association must first\\nexhaust internal remedies before filing\\nsuit, Chamblee agrees that the union had\\nthe right to make its own regulations, but\\nhe says that in administering its rules, the\\nunion must act in good faith and must not\\nviolate the laws of the land or the rights\\nof their members, and that the union failed\\nto follow those standards in his case.\\nChamblee also agrees that, as a general rule,\\na member of a voluntary association must\\nfirst exhaust all internal remedies, but he\\nclaims that it would have been futile in his\\ncase to seek relief through union procedure\\nbecause the individuals he named as defend-\\nants in the lawsuit were officers in control\\nof all union channels of relief, and since\\nhe sought compensation in damages, he need\\nnot allege that he has sought relief through\\nunion channels. We agree with the con-\\ntentions of the union in this particular case.\\nIn his lawsuit, Chamblee sought, and receiv-\\ned, reinstatement in the union as a “retired”\\nemployee. Chamblee contends that this\\nrelief was proper since he claims damages,\\nand that appeal within the union would not\\nafford full redress. He cites Grand In-\\nternational B. of L. Engineers v. Green,\\n210 Ala. 496, 98 So. 569 (1923). As we\\nread the Grand International B. of L. En-\\ngineers case, it stands for the proposition\\nthat when a member seeks “reinstatement,”\\nit is necessary for him to seek relief within\\nthe union first. This Court there held as\\nfollows:\\n\\n“Several special pleas advanced the\\nproposition that plaintiff had no standing\\nin court by reason of the fact that he had\\nnot exhausted the remedy in such cases\\nafforded by the law of the association for\\nthat he had failed to appeal to the Gen-\\neral Convention. If plaintiff had pro-\\nceeded with the purpose merely to compel\\nhis restoration to membership, it would\\nhave been necessary that he first seek\\nrelief in the tribunal of final decision\\n\\nwithin the organization (State ex rel.\\nMcNeill v. Bibb Street Church, 84 Ala.\\n23, 4 So. 40; Medical & Surgical Society\\nv. Weatherly, 75 Ala, 248)—this for the\\nreason that the remedy in the courts is of\\nsuch nature that it is allowed as a last\\nresort. In the present case the plaintiff\\ndoes not seek reinstatemerit; he seeks\\ncompensation in damages for the injury\\ndone to his personal and property rights\\nby the wrongful, malicious, or wrongful\\nand malicious, expulsion from the broth-\\nerhood. The authorities may not be in\\nagreement as to whether in such case the\\nplaintiff must need show that he has\\ntaken the judgment of the tribunal of last\\nresort within the organization; but our\\njudgment is that the better view is that\\nthe plaintiff in a case such as we have\\nhere need not allege or show that he has\\nsought by appeal to avoid the decree of\\nexpulsion for the reason that a reversal\\nof the decree would not afford full re-\\ndress for the injury to his property rights\\nand other damages suffered on account\\nof his expulsion from the brotherhood.\\nThompson v. Grand International Broth-\\nerhood of Locomotive Engineers, 41 Tex.\\nCiv.App. 176, 91 S.W. 834; 5 C.J. 1357.”\\n\\nIn his complaint, Chamblee affirmatively\\nseeks “reinstatement.” In essence, he\\nsought to have the Court construe the con-\\nstitution and bylaws of the union and to or-\\nder his reinstatement as a “retired” mem-\\nber. Chamblee does not allege bad faith\\nor discrimination in his complaint, but\\nmakes only a conclusionary assertion of ar-\\nbitrariness. As was said in Sharp v.\\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 223\\nAla, 202, 135 So. 327 (1931) :\\n\\n“The facts alleged are incompatible\\nwith any charge of fraud or unfair or ar-\\nbitrary ruling, and no such charge is\\nmade, but they show only a construction\\nof the rules of the order upon a matter\\nas to which an honest difference of opin-\\nion may well appear to exist. But the\\ncourts are indisposed to interfere with\\nthe internal management of such organ-\\nizations, and do not grant relief under\\n\\n\\n_ 79\\na\\n\\nsuch circumstances. Grand International\\nB. of L. Engineers v. Green, 210 Ala. 496,\\n98 So, 569, 572. As said by the West\\nVirginia court in Simpson v. Grand Inter-\\nnational B. of L. Engineers, 83 W.Va.\\n355, 98 S.E. 580, 587; ‘The construction\\nof the organic agreement, bylaws, rules\\nand regulations of a benefit society or\\nother unincorporated voluntary associa-\\ntion belongs, not to the court, but to the\\nboard, council, or other tribunal provided\\nfor the purpose in the organization, if\\nany. So long as the body upon which this\\npower of interpretation has been con-\\nferred does not substitute legislation for\\ninterpretation, nor transgress the bounds\\nof reason, common sense or fairness, nor\\ncontravene public policy or the laws of\\nthe land, in their conclusions and deci-\\nsions, the courts cannot interfere with\\nthem,”\\n\\nHI Implicit in the court’s decree order-\\ning Chamblee’s reinstatement is a finding\\nthat under the union’s constitution and by-\\nlaws, Chamblee was a “retired” employee.\\nThe court erred in making this finding\\n\\nHM Alabama follows the generally ac-\\ncepted view throughout the country that the\\ncourt will not interfere with the internal\\noperations of a voluntary association. The\\nlower court violated this rule of “noninter-\\nference” and because of that, its judgment\\n\\n1. ‘That the court misconstrued its role and\\nundertook to interpret union rules is shown\\nby the following colloquy :\\n\\n“Q Well, let me ask you this, you\\'re fam-\\nilar with the constitution and by-laws of\\nLocal 2206?\\n“A Yes, sir,\\n“Q Now tell us the official position of\\nLocal 2206 with respect to the right of an\\nemployee who resigns from federal service\\nas spposed to retires—that right to re-\\ntain a membership in the local union.\\n“MR.

We affirm.\\n\\nOn September 27, 1969, Savannah Wind-\\nsor purchased a 1970 Buick Skylark from\\nJim Burke Buick in Birmingham. She\\nsigned an installment sales contract which\\nwas later assigned to General Motors Ac-\\nceptance Corporation (GMAC). She made\\na downpayment of $525.00 and agreed to\\npay the balance in thirty-six monthly in-\\nstallments of $141.93, ‘The debt was refi-\\n\\naS\\nnanced on December 10, 1971. Between\\nDecember, 1971 and February, 1973, her\\npayments were delinquent repeatedly, On\\nFebruary 16, 1973, GMAC repossessed the\\nautomobile.\\n\\nSavannah Windsor then brought an ac-\\ntion against GMAC for conversion of her\\nautomobile, invasion of privacy, and con-\\nversion of certain miscellaneous personal\\nproperty. Lue Bertha Windsor, Savan-\\nnah’s mother, brought an action against\\nGMAC for “injuries suffered as a result\\nof the Defendants intentionally engaging\\nin a campaign to harass and intimidate her\\nin connection with alleged arrearage of her\\ndaughter’s installment agreement with Gen-\\neral Motors Acceptance Corporation.”\\nThe two actions were consolidated for\\ntrial. The trial judge directed a verdict in\\nfavor of the defendant in Lue Bertha’s\\ncase. The only issue submitted to the jury\\nin Savannah’s case was whether or not\\nthere was a conversion of the personal\\nproperty which Savannah claimed was in\\nthe car at the time it was repossessed.\\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of\\nGMAC. Savannah and Lué Bertha Wind-\\nsor appeal.\\n\\nHH Assignments of Error 4, 6, 10, and\\n19 are’that the trial judge erred in grant-\\ning defendants’ motion for a directed ver-\\ndict in Lue Bertha Windsor’s case. Lue\\nBertha contends that GMAC harassed her\\nand invaded her privacy in its efforts to\\ncollect Savannahs debt.\\n\\nIn Norris v. Moskin Stores, 272 Ala.\\n174, 132 So.2d 321, it was said:\\n\\n“The mere efforts of a creditor, in\\nthis case the appellees, to collect a debt\\ncannot without more be considered a\\nwrongful and actionable intrusion. A\\ncreditor has and must have the right to\\ntake reasonable action to pursue his\\ndebtor and collect his debt. But the\\nright to pursue the debtor is not a li-\\ncense to outrage the debtor. The prob-\\nlem of defining the scope of the right of\\nprivacy in the debtor-creditor situation\\n\\n\\n83\\n\\nis the problem of balancing the interest\\nof the creditor in collecting his debt\\nagainst that of the debtor in his own\\npersonality. Some courts appear to have\\nstruck that balance on the so-called\\n‘rule of reason” Thus in the recent case\\nof Housh v. Peth, 99 Ohio App. 485, 135\\nN.E.2d 440, 449, affirmed 165 Ohio St.\\n35, 133 N.E.2d 340, the Ohio appellate\\ncourts asserted that ‘a creditor has a\\nright to take reasonable action to pursue\\nhis debtor and persuade payment, al-\\nthough the steps taken may result to a\\ncertain degree in the invasion of the\\ndebtor’s right of privacy,’ but that the\\ndebtor has a cause of action for inju-\\nrious conduct on the part of the creditor\\nwhich exceeds the bounds of reasonable-\\nness. We approve this statement.”\\n\\nThe pertinent evidence produced at trial\\nis as follows: Savannah Windsor lived at\\nhome with her mother, Lue Bertha. Bill\\nDavis, a GMAC representative in charge\\nof accounts, contacted Savannah, either by\\ntelephone or in person at her home, about\\nfifteen or twenty times over a one or two-\\nyear period prior to repossession about her\\ndelinquent payments. Davis did not call or\\ncome by except when Savannah was be-\\nhind on her payments. Sometimes Davis\\nwould call when Savannah was not at\\nhome. He came by the house several times\\nin spite of the fact that Lue Bertha had\\ntold him over the telephone that Savannah\\nwas not there. Lue Bertha testified that\\nhe “would talk down” to her, that after he\\ncalled she “just went crazy, like to have\\ndied,” and that on one occasion she “went\\nto the hospital and stayed there.” On\\ncross-examination, Lue Bertha testified as\\nfollows:\\n\\n“Q (BY MR. FERNAMBUCQ) How\\nmany times did he call you on the tele-\\nphone over the period of time we\\'re talk-\\ning about?\\n\\n“A Well, it was several times, I don’t\\nremember.\\n\\n“Q As a matter of fact, when we took\\nyour deposition, you said three or four\\ntimes?\\n\\n“A\\n“Q\\n“A\\n\\n“Q That took place over a period of\\nmonths, is that right?\\n\\n“A That’s right.\\n\\nThat’s the way it was.\\nThree or four times?\\n\\nThat’s right.\\n\\n* * * Ea * *\\n\\n“Q And these three or four times when\\nthis Mr. Davis called, all he ever called\\nyou and talked to you about was the bill,\\nabout the car payment?\\n\\n“A That’s right.\\n“Q Did you ever talk to him face to\\nface out there at your house?\\n\\n“A Well, I would see him, I had a win-\\ndow, would look out the window and see\\nwhen he would get there.\\n\\n«9\\n“n\\n\\n“Q And the only contact he made with\\nyou was three or four or maybe five\\ntimes when he called you on the phone?\\n\\n“A That\\'s right.”\\n\\nYou were hid?\\n\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nFrom all the evidence, the trial court\\nwas convinced that there was not a scintil-\\nla of evidence in support of Lue Bertha’s\\nallegation that GMAC unreasonably .invad-\\ned her privacy in an attempt to collect Sa-\\nvannah’s debt. A directed verdict in favor\\nof GMAC naturally followed and we find\\nno error in that action.\\n\\nIr\\n\\nHM Assignments of Error 12 and 13\\naré that the trial judge erred in Savannah\\nWindsor’s case when he, in effect, directed\\na verdict in favor of GMAC as to the in-\\nvasion of privacy issue.\\n\\n\\n84\\n\\nIn Norris v. Moskin, supra, we cited\\nwith approval Gouldman-Taber Pontiac v.\\nZerbst, 213 Ga, 682, 100 S.E.2d 881, and\\nTollefson v. Safeway Stores, (Colo.) 142\\nColo. 442, 351 P.2d 274. In Zerbst, it was\\nheld that a single letter written by the de-\\nfendant-creditor to the plaintiff-debtor’s\\nemployer, merely notifying him of the debt,\\ndid not constitute an actionable invasion of\\nplaintiff\\'s privacy. In Safeway, a defend-\\nant bill collector informed plaintiff\\'s wife\\nthat if the debt were not paid, plaintiff\\'s\\njob would be in jeopardy. He also con-\\ntacted plaintiff\\'s superiors, seeking ‘to\\nbring pressure on plaintiff to pay. The\\nSupreme Court of Colorado held that on\\nthese facts, plaintiff had no cause of ac-\\ntion for invasion of privacy, pointing out\\nthat “there was no campaign of continuous\\nharassment, no attempt to vilify or expose\\nplaintiff to public ridicule, and no effort to\\ncause plaintiff to lose his position.”\\n\\nIn the present case, after Bill Davis re-\\npossessed the car, he drove to the Alabas-\\nter police station.\\nwhat he had done in the event the car was\\nreported as having been stolen. Later that\\nsame day, a policeman went by the school\\nwhere Savannah was employed. There, in\\nthe presence of the assistant principal, she\\nwas informed that her car had been repos-\\nsessed. The evidence also showed that Bill\\nDavis asked James McQueen, who was not\\na regular employee of GMAC, to inventory\\nand return Savannah Windsor’s personal\\nproperty which was in the car at the time\\nit was repossessed.\\n\\nFrom the foregoing authority and the\\nfacts presented at trial, it is evident that\\nthere was not a scintilla of evidence in\\nsupport of the claimed invasion of privacy.\\nThere was no error in directing the verdict\\non the invasion of privacy issue.\\n\\nHM Assignments of Error 11 and 21\\nare that the trial judge erred in charging\\nthe jury that “from all the evidence in the\\ncase the repossession of the automobile\\nwas not wrongful.”\\n\\nHe told the dispatcher *\\n\\nTitle 7A, § 9-503, UCC, gives a secured\\nparty the right to take possession of collat-\\neral after default. Savannah Windsor ad-\\nmitted that she was one payment behind at\\nthe time that the automobile was repos-\\nsessed, There was no error in this in-\\nstruction.\\n\\nHM Plaintiff, Savannah Windsor, also\\ncontended that some of her personal be-\\nlongings in the car were not returned.\\n\\nThe installment sales contract provided\\nas follows:\\n\\n“[In the event of default] * * *\\n\\n* © * seller or any sheriff or other\\nofficer of the law may take immediate\\npossession of said property without de-\\nmand, and without process including any\\nequipment or accessories thereto; and\\nfor this purpose seller may enter upon\\nthe premises where said property may be\\nand remove same.

After her death, the re-\\nmaining corpus is to be distributed to her\\nchildren and grandchildren or, if she dies\\nchildless, to the executor or administrator\\nof her estate.\\n\\nIn her complaint, the beneficiary makes\\nspecific claims for relief in the alternative:\\n\\n“1, Terminate said Trust Agreement\\nbecause it violates the rule against per-\\npetuities ;\\n\\n“2, Terminate said Trust Agreement\\nbecause of the impossibility in carrying\\nout the material purpose or object of the\\nSettlor to provide for successive bene-\\nficiaries, including Complainant, which\\nmaterial purpose or object will not now\\ncome about;\\n\\n“3, Terminate said Trust Agreement\\nbecause the beneficial interest in said\\nTrust Agreement has become vested sole-\\n\\n88\\n\\nly in Complainant and she desires and\\nconsents to said termination;\\n\\n“4, Modify said Trust Agreement to\\norder Respondent to distribute all of the\\nincome generated by the principal amount\\nof said Trust Agreement on a monthly\\nbasis to Complainant ;\\n\\n“5. Modify said Trust Agreement to\\nincrease the monthly benefits paid to\\nComplainant by an amount which the\\nCourt finds the Settlor would have done\\nif he still lived;\\n\\n“6. Complainant prays for such other,\\nfurther, different and general relief as\\nthe Court deems fit and proper and of-\\nfers to do equity.”\\n\\nThe instrument in question is dated Feb-\\nruary 23, 1943, On that date appellant, the\\nsettlor’s only child and the life beneficiary\\nunder his trust, was 26 years old. Under\\nthe original terms of the trust, the life ben-\\neficiary was to receive monthly payments\\nin the amount of $100.00, payable out of\\ntrust income or principal, if necessary. Pri-\\nor to his death in 1968, the settlor twice ex-\\nercised a reserved power to increase the\\nmonthly payment to the beneficiary, by\\nfirst raising the monthly payment to $150.00\\nand by later raising it to the present level\\n\\nat $400.00.\\n\\nThis power to increase the monthly pay-\\nment to the life beneficiary was reserved by\\nthe following provision in the trust: “upon\\ndelivery of any additional securities,\\nmonies, property, or other evidences of in-\\ndebtedness to the trustee, [the settlor] may\\namend the instructions with reference to\\nthe monthly payments to be made to the\\nbeneficiary by instructing in writing the ad-\\nditional amount of monthly payments to be\\nmade because of the additions to the corpus\\nof the trust.” In addition, the trust re-\\nserves to the settlor the power to add addi-\\ntional assets to the trust fund at any time.\\n\\nIn brief, the life beneficiary estimates\\nthat the trust corpus is “in excess of $150,-\\n000.00” and that $7,000.00 in excess trust\\n\\nincome is being added annually to the cor-\\npus. The beneficiary argues that the pres-\\nent accumulation of corpus and the amount\\nof annual excess trust income added to cor-\\npus are circumstances that were not fore-\\nseen by the settlor and that, in order to ef-\\nfectuate the original trust purpose, it has\\nbecome necessary and proper either to in-\\ncrease the size of the monthly payment to\\nthe beneficiary or to terminate the trust.\\nAs appellee, the trustee insists that the ben-\\neficiary’s estimates as to the value of the\\ntrust corpus and excess trust income are\\nsubstantially greater than the actual market\\nvalues.\\n\\nIn further support of her cause, the life\\nbeneficiary argues that her lack of off-\\nspring and her inability to have offspring\\n[she has undergone a hysterectomy] fore-\\nclose the possibility of eventual distribution\\nto remaindermen since the only remainder-\\nmen specified under the terms of the trust\\nare the life beneficiary’s “children and\\ngrandchildren.” The life beneficiary: the-\\norizes that because she is the present own-\\ner of a beneficial interest in the trust and\\nthat because such ownership will pass to\\nher estate upon her death, all beneficial in-\\nterests under the trust have been merged\\nunder what is her common ownership, for\\nall practical purposes.\\n\\nThe life beneficiary relies on case law\\nfrom various jurisdictions to support her\\ncontention that merger in the same party\\nof both a life interest and a remainder in-\\nterest in the res of a trust compels the ter-\\nmination of the trust, Along the same\\nline she also argues that a trust may be ter-\\nminated if all parties holding beneficial in-\\nterests in the trust agree to its termination.\\n\\nWhether the beneficiary is entitled to the\\nrelief she requests is not an issue raised by\\nthe instant appeal. Rather, the crucial\\nquestion presented is whether the court was\\nin error in granting the trustee’s Rule 12(b)\\n(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a\\nclaim upon which relief can be granted,\\nWe think this was error and reverse and\\nremand,\\n\\n\\n89\\n\\nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99,\\n2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) is the case most often\\nreferred to in the federal cases as setting\\nout the proper test of the sufficiency of a\\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Fed-\\neral Rules of Civil Procedure. [That rule\\nis exactly the same as Rule 12(b) (6), A.R.\\nC.P.] In that case, the Supreme Court of\\nthe United States stated that:\\n\\n“In appraising the sufficiency of the\\ncomplaint we follow, of course, the ac-\\ncepted rule that a complaint should not\\n\\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim”\\n\\nunless it appears beyond doubt that the\\nplaintiff can prove no set of facts in\\nsupport of his claim which would entitle\\nhim to relief.”\\n\\n355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. at 102, 2 L.Ed,\\n2d at 84. This test has been followed by\\nthis Court in the case of Bowling v. Pow,\\n293 Ala. 178, 301 So.2d 55 (1974). In Wat-\\nwood v. R. R. Dawson Bridge Co., 293 Ala.\\n578, 307 So.2d 692 (1974), this Court again\\nindicated its adoption of the rule set out in\\nConley v. Gibson: “[I]n reviewing the suf-\\nficiency of a complaint, it should not be\\ndismissed unless it appears beyond doubt\\nthat the plaintiff can prove no set of facts\\nin support of his claim which would entitle\\nhim to relief.” 293 Ala. at 581, 307 So.2d\\nat 693-94,\\n\\nHI Under the facts of the instant case,\\nthe beneficiary claims to be entitled to a\\ndeclaratory judgment in favor of the modi-\\nfication or termination of the trust in ques-\\ntion. This Court has held that the proper\\ntest of the sufficiency of the complaint in a\\ndeclaratory judgment proceeding is wheth-\\ner “the complaint states the substance of a\\nbona fide justiciable controversy which\\nshould be settled.” City of Bessemer v.\\nBessemer Theatres, Inc., 252 Ala. 117, 120,\\n39 So.2d 658, 660-61 (1949). The rule set\\nout in Corretti v. First Nat\\'l. Bank, 290 Ala.\\n280, 276 So.2d 141 (1973) is even more di-\\nrectly on point in the instant appeal. In\\nCorretti this Court held that the sufficiency\\nof the complaint in a declaratory judgment\\n\\nproceeding involving a trust is to be deter-\\nmined by the absence or presence of “bona\\nfide doubt as to the true meaning and intent\\nof the provisions of the instrument creating\\nthe trust or as to the particular course\\nwhich the trustee should pursue.” 290 Ala.\\nat 286, 276 So.2d at 146.\\n\\nHI The trustee in this cause insists that\\na justiciable controversy involving a trust\\ncan exist only where the terms of the in-\\nstrument are unclear or ambiguous. With-\\nout venturing to comment on the ambiguity\\nvel non of the instrument involved here,\\nwe point out that there are circumstances\\nunder which a-court may exercise juris-\\ndiction over a trust instrument in the ab-\\nsence of any ambiguity in the terms of\\nthe instrument itself. For example, de-\\nviation from the unambiguous terms of a\\ntrust is sometimes allowed under the doc-\\ntrine of equitable deviation. See Thurlow\\nv. Berry, 249 Ala. 597, 32 So.2d 526 (1947).\\n\\nHJ The successful assertion of the the-\\nories upon which the beneficiary relies in\\nseeking a modification or termination of\\nthe trust is dependent upon a judicial find-\\ning that the objects of the trust are those\\nset out in her complaint. According to\\nthe Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 337,\\ncomment e at 159 (1959), if the trust pur-\\nposes are expressed in the trust instrument,\\n“a different purpose cannot be shown by\\nextrinsic evidence.” On the other hand,\\nif the trust purposes are not expressly\\nstated, they may be construed from the\\nlanguage of the trust language with the\\naid of extrinsic evidence of circumstances\\nsurrounding the creation of the trust. Id.\\nOur reading of the trust instrument in this\\ncase has not revealed an express statement\\nof the purposes of the trust. Moreover, it\\nwould be inappropriate at this juncture for\\nthis Court to speculate as to the settlor’s\\npossible purposes, since that is a matter\\nproperly reserved for resolution in the trial\\n\\ncourt in the first instance.\\n\\nHE We are, of course, cognizant of\\nthe long-standing general rule that “neither\\n\\n90\\n\\nthe settlor, trustee, or beneficiaries can\\nchange the terms of the trust” unless such\\nchanges are expressly authorized in the\\ntrust instrument. G. Bogart, Handbook of\\nthe Law of Trusts § 145, at 573 (4th ed.\\n1963). Likewise, we are familiar with the\\nprevailing American rule that if compliance\\nwith the trust terms “is necessary to carry\\n\\nout a material purpose of the trust, the ©\\n\\nbeneficiaries cannot compel its termina-\\ntion.” Restatement (Second) of Trusts §\\n337(2) (1959).\\n\\nAlthough the foregoing rules represent\\nwell-settled principles of law, they are not\\ncontrolling of the issues raised by this ap-\\npeal. The determinative issue on this ap-\\npeal is what standard should govern a mo-\\ntion for dismissal under Rule 12(b) (6) in a\\ndeclaratory judgment proceeding. We\\nthink that the proper standard is the one\\nset out in our case of Robinson v. Robinson,\\n273 Ala. 192, 136 So.2d 889 (1962), although\\nRobinson was rendered prior to the adop-\\ntion of the Alabama Rules of Civil Proce-\\ndure.\\n\\nHE In Robinson, this Court held that\\n“[t}he test of the sufficiency of [a com-\\nplaint for declaratory relief] is not whether\\nthe complaint shows that the complainant\\nwill succeed in getting a declaration of\\nrights in accordance with his theory or con-\\ntention, but whether he is entitled to a dec-\\nlaration of rights at all.” 273 Ala. at 195—\\n96, 136 So.2d at 891 (emphasis added).\\nOur application of the Robinson standard\\ncompels us to the conclusion that the bene-\\nficiary in this case was entitled to a deter-\\nmination of her cause, on its merits. We\\nscannot say that, as a matter of law, it is\\nbeyond doubt that the beneficiary could not\\nprove any set of facts which would entitle\\nher to some part of the relief requested in\\nher complaint. Conley v. Gibson, supra.\\n\\nIn considering an issue involving a 12(b)\\n(6) motion, the Fifth Circuit Court of Ap-\\npeals has admonished that “the more ex-\\ntreme or even far-fetched is the asserted\\ntheory of liability, the more important it is\\nthat the conceptual legal theories be ex-\\n\\nplored and assayed in the light of actual\\nfacts, not a pleader’s supposition.” Shull\\nv. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 313 F.2d 445, 447 (5\\nCir., 1963) (emphasis added), This Court’s\\ndecision in Bowling v. Pow, 293 Ala. 178,\\n301 So.2d 55 (1974), follows the policy ad-\\nvocated in the Shull case. In Bowling, -\\nmembers of this Court upheld the plaintiff\\'s\\ntight to a determination on the merits of\\nhis cause in spite of the Court’s feeling\\nthat, “It may well be that the plaintiff has\\nan extraordinarily hard road to travel to\\nconvince the trial court that he is entitled\\nto have the trier of facts determine whether\\nany part of the letter was understood in a\\ndefamatory sense . 2” 293 Ala. at\\n187-88, 301 So.2d at 64.\\n\\nTI The policy mandating restraint in\\nthe granting of motions under Rule 12(b)\\n(6), adopted by both the, federal and the\\nAlabama systems, can be implemented by\\napplication of the standard set out in Con-\\nley v. Gibson. That standard requires that\\nthe Court first determine whether “it ap-\\npears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can\\nprove no set of facts in support of his\\nclaim which would entitle him to relief.”\\nId., 355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. at 102, 2\\nL.Ed.2d at 84. If the Court finds itself\\nin doubt as to whether the plaintiff could\\nprove such a set of facts, the motion to dis-\\nmiss for failure to state a claim upon which\\nrelief can be granted must be denied. Of\\ncourse, by denying a Rule 12(b)(6) motion\\nunder these circumstances and then con-\\nsidering the cause on its merits, the Court,\\nis not precluded from a later determination\\nthat the complainant is not entitled to the\\nrelief he seeks. In that event, the appropri-\\nate ruling is a summary judgment. We\\nagree with the text book authorities that\\n“[t]he motion for summary judgment pro-\\nvides a more expeditious and effective pro-\\ncedure [as contrasted to the motion for\\ndismissal for failure to state a claim upon\\nwhich relief can be granted] for quickly\\nterminating an action that does not appear\\nto merit relief on its substantive merits.” 5\\nWright and Miller, Federal Practice and\\nProcedure § 1357, at 603-04 (1969).\\n\\n\\n91\\n\\nHHI Dismissal for failure to state a\\nclaim for which relief can be granted is a\\ntool which should be used sparingly. In\\nview of our inability to rid ourselves of all\\ndoubt that the beneficiary cannot prove any_\\nset of facts which would entitle her to re-\\nlief, we reverse the. ruling of the lower\\ncourt in this cause and remand the cause\\nfor further consideration in the light of\\nthis opinion.\\n\\nReversed and remanded.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

On the\\ncustomer’s rented lot, there was a concrete\\nblock which was used as a step from the\\n\\ntop of a retaining wall to the area adjacent\\nto’ the customer’s trailer.

Cox also contracted to sell\\nthis cotton to certain mills and brokers, in-\\ncluding Kelly Co., and Kelly Co. subse-\\nquently contracted to sell the cotton to\\nHartwell Mills.\\n\\nBy the autumn of 1973, the price of cot-\\n\\n_ton_had more than doubled. Naturally,\\n\\nmany cotton farmers were not eager to sell\\ntheir cotton to Cox at the contract price of\\n34¢ to 36¢ per pound. On September 28,\\n1973, Cox filed a complaint seeking to en-\\njoin the cotton farmers from breaching the\\ncontracts wherein they were obligated to\\nsell him their 1973 cotton crops. Cox also\\nsought a declaratory judgment against Kel-\\nly Co. and the cotton mills as to his\\n(Cox’s) liability under the contracts\\nwherein he had agreed to sell them cotton\\nat a stipulated price.\\n\\nOn October 8, 1973, the trial court\\ngranted a preliminary injunction against\\nthe cotton farmers who had contracted to\\nsell their cotton to Cox.\\n\\nOn October 26, 1973, Kelly Co, and the\\ncotton mills filed an answer and counter-\\nclaim against Cox seeking (1) a declara-\\ntion that the written contracts between\\nthem and Cox were binding and enforce-\\nable and (2) damages, in case Cox did not\\ndeliver the specified number of bales of\\ncotton. On November 5, 1973, they filed\\nan amended answer and counterclaim\\nagainst Cox, asking that he be enjoined\\nfrom breaching his contracts with them.\\nThe hearing on the injunction was had on\\nNovember 14, 1973. The testimony ad-\\nduced at the previous hearings was made a\\npart of the record.\\n\\nOn December 4, 1973, the trial court\\ngranted a preliminary injunction against\\nCox. But despite this injunction, Cox\\nclaimed that he was unable to deliver all of\\nthe cotton as specified under his contracts\\nwith the brokers and the mills.\\n\\nThe trial court severed Kelly Co’s. coun-\\nterclaim from that of the cotton mills’\\n\\n[Kelly was severed because it was not reg-\\nistered to do business in this state], and\\nth ecase proceeded to trial on November\\n12, 1974, The findings of the trial court,\\nin pertinent part, are as follows:\\n\\n“That Cox entered into three contracts\\nto ship Kelly a total of 1800 bales of cot-\\nton. Cox fulfilled Contract No. 743,\\ncovering 200 bales. Contract No, 742\\ncovered 1300 bales at 36¢ per pound, and\\nCox shipped Kelly 920 bales, leaving a\\nshortage of 380 bales on this contract.\\nContract No, 744 covered 300 bales at a\\nprice of 34¢ per pound. No cotton was\\nshipped under this contract. Thus, of\\nthe total of 1800 bales contracted for,\\nCox shipped Kelly 1120 bales and was\\nshort 680 bales. Kelly had the burden of\\nproof as to the amount of his damages\\nsustained as a result of this breach by\\nCox. * * ¥*”\\n\\nNeither side seriously disputes this part\\nof the decree and we agree that these fig-\\nures should be the basis of computation of\\ndamages. The error is in the next part of\\nthe decree which follows:\\n\\n“* * % Having heard the evidence in\\nthe trial, and having carefully reviewed\\nsame since the trial, the Court is reason-\\nably satisfied that Kelly is still obligated\\nto deliver to Hartwell Mills 680 bales of\\ncotton at the price contracted for. The\\nCourt is not reasonably satisfied that\\nKelly actually ‘covered’ the cotton called\\nfor in his contracts with Cox, There\\nwas no evidence offered to show the\\nmarket price of cotton at the time when\\nKelly learned of the breach. The only\\nevidence as to the price of cotton as of\\nthe date of the trial was 40¢ per pound,\\nwhich the Court must necessarily use in\\nassessing Kelly’s damages. The Court\\nthus concludes that Kelly’s damages\\namounted to the sum of $16,600, and that\\nKelly is entitled to this amount plus in-\\nterest from the date of the breach:”\\n\\nWe cannot agree with the trial court’s con-\\nclusions that led to the $16,600.00 judgment\\nin this case. We think the trial court\\n\\n\\nerred in three instances which require that\\nthe judgment be reversed.\\n\\nI First, we cannot agree that Kelly\\nCo. did not cover the 680 bales of cotton it\\nwas obligated to deliver to Hartwell Mills.\\n\\nCover is operationally defined in Code of\\nAlabama, Tit. 7A, § 2-712(1) (Recomp.\\n1958) (Supp.1966), which states as fol-\\nlows:\\n\\n“(1) After a breach within the preced-\\ning section [§ 2-711, dealing in pertinent\\npart with buyers’ remedies when the seller\\nfails to deliver] the buyer may ‘cover’ by\\nmaking in good faith and without unrea-\\nsonable delay any reasonable purchase of\\nor contract to purchase goods in substi-\\ntution of those due from the seller.”\\n\\nThere is ample evidence in the record to\\nsupport the conclusion that Kelly Co. did\\ncover the 680 bales of cotton which Cox\\nfailed to deliver to Kelly Co. An example\\nof this is found in the direct testimony of\\nMr. R. N. Kelly, President of Kelly, Co., on\\ndirect examination:\\n\\n“Q. Did R. N. Kelly Cotton Merchant,\\n\\nInc. ship in the year 1973 680 bales or\\n\\nmore to the Hartwell Mills in Georgia to\\n\\nreplace the cotton which is the subject of\\n\\nExhibits C-1, D-1 and E-1 [Contracts\\n\\nnumbered 742, 743 and 744 evidencing\\n\\nthe sale of cotton between Kelly Co. and\\n\\nCox] which was not delivered?\\n\\n“A That’s right.”\\nIn the course of the same testimony, we\\nfind as follows:\\n\\n“Q And during 1973 R. N. Kelly Cotton\\nMerchant, Inc. did purchase at least 680\\nbales to replace the cotton required un-\\nder the contracts?\\n\\n“A Yes, sir.\\n\\n[Objection by Messrs. Bell and Lang]\\n\\n“Q: Would you answer that?\\n\\n“A Yes, sir, I bought cotton for them.”\\nThese excerpts from Mr. Kelly’s testimony,\\n\\nalong with other evidence found in the rec-\\nord are supportive of a conclusion that\\n\\n97\\n\\nKelly Co. did cover the 680 bales of cotton\\ncontracted to Hartwell Mills. The evi-\\ndence shows that this cotton which Kelly\\nCo, covered was the 680 bales it would\\nhave received from Cox but for Cox’s\\nbreach of his contracts with Kelly Co.\\n\\nHad the trial court been correct in its\\nfinding that Kelly Co. had not “covered”\\nthe cotton contracted for with Cox, then\\nthe remainder of the decree would have\\nbeen correct, But in view of our holding\\nthat Kelly Co. did cover, that automatically\\nmade the computation part of the decree\\nerroneous. That is the second phase of the\\ndecree.\\n\\nHl The trial court found that there\\nwas no evidence of the market price of\\ncotton at the time of Cox’s breach and,\\ntherefore, chose to use 40¢ per pound, a fig-\\nure it termed “* * * The only evidence\\nas to the price of cotton as of the date of\\nthe trial * * *” as a measure of dam-\\nages, The court was correct in its deter-\\nmination that there was no evidence in the\\nrecord of the market price of the cotton on\\nthe date of Cox’s breach of the contract.\\nBut market price is not necessary in order\\nto determine damages awarded to a party\\nwho has covered. The statute governing\\ndamages available in instances of cover is\\nCode of Alabama, Tit. 7A, § 2-712(2),\\n(Recomp.1958) (Supp.1966), which states\\nas follows:\\n\\n“(2) The buyer may recover from the\\nseller as damages the difference between\\nthe cost of cover and the contract price\\ntogether with any incidental or conse-\\nquential damages as hereinafter defined\\n(section 2-715), but less expenses saved\\nin consequence of the seller’s breach.”\\n\\nThere is uncontradicted evidence in the\\nrecord of the average price Kelly Co. paid\\nfor the covered cotton. This cover price,\\ndesignated in the statute, provides a fairer\\nmeasurer of damages to Kelly Co. than\\nthat erroneously set by the trial court.\\nFor evidence of the cost of cover, we turn\\n\\n98\\n\\nagain to Mr. Kelly’s testimony, which is as\\nfollows:\\n\\n“Q And what was the average price per\\n\\npound charged R. N. Kelly Cotton Mer-,\\n\\nchant, Inc. for that replacement cotton\\n[the covered cotton] ?\\n\\n[Objection by Mr. Lang]\\n“A What we actually paid was 78.46.\\n“Q_ Put decimal points in there.\\n\\n“A Seventy-eight, point forty-six cents\\napound.* * *”\\n\\nAnd later in the same testimony, we find\\nthe following:\\n\\n“Q Did you pay 78.46 a pound on the\\naverage for it [cotton covered to Hart-\\nwell Mills]?\\n\\n“A On the average, yes, sir.”\\n\\nThe testimony of Mr. Kelly as to the\\naverage cost of cover more nearly reflects\\nthe actual damages sustained by Kelly Co.\\nThat cost is a necessary factor in estab-\\nlishing damages sanctioned by the Code in\\nsituations where the buyer has invoked the\\nremedy of cover.\\n\\nHMM Specific evidence as to the cost\\nof cover is not necessary; a mere average,\\nto which Mr. Kelly testified, is adequate.\\nAlabama’s Commercial Code rejects the\\ntheory that damages must be calculable\\nwith mathematical accuracy. The Official\\nComment to Tit. 7A, § 1-106 (Recomp.\\n1958) (Supp.1966), suggests: “* * *\\nCompensatory damages aré often at best\\napproximate: they have to be proved with\\nwhatever definiteness and accuracy the\\nfacts permit, but no more.” Testimony\\nprovided by Mr. Kelly met this standard.\\nTherefore, we hold: that the trial court\\nerred in its application of the 40¢ per\\npound price in order to award damages to\\nKelly Co.\\n\\nIn the final instance, by basing its award\\nof damages on the two erroneous conclu-\\nsions as to cover and damages awarded for\\ncover drawn by the trial court, that court’s\\nfinal calculation of damages totaling\\n$16,600.00 and interest was also in error.\\n\\nRather than calculating damages at a price\\nof 40¢ per pound for the 680 bales (each\\nbale containing 500 pounds) that Kelly Co.\\nhad to cover, the court should have used\\nthe difference between the cost of cover\\n(78.46¢ per pound) and the contract price,\\nplus incidental and consequential damages.\\nThe cause is remanded for the calculation\\nof damages and the rendering of a judg-\\nment in accordance with this opinion.\\n\\nReversed and remanded with instruc-\\ntions.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Act No. 750 provides in\\npart:\\n\\n“Section 1, Any rule, regulation or\\nlaw limiting the number of times that\\nany person, otherwise qualified may ap-\\nply for and stand the Alabama Bar Ex-\\namination at any regular examination\\nsession is hereby prohibited. However,\\nno applicant may take the examination\\nmore than three (3) times in any three\\n(3) year period.”\\n\\nSince 1934, the Board of Commissioners\\nof the Alabama State Bar has followed the\\npractice of limiting to three the number of\\ntimes one may sit for the bar examination.\\nRule IV(D), as it now exists, was passed\\nby the Commissioners on July 22, 1961, and\\nprovides:\\n\\n“No applicant shall be permitted to\\ntake the examination, under these rules,\\n\\n\\n104\\n\\nmore than three times unless subsequent\\napplications by such applicant are ap-\\nproved by the Board of Commissioners\\nof the Alabama State Bar.”\\n\\nThe complaint was dismissed for lack of\\nan actual controversy of justiciable charac-\\nter and because of a lack of jurisdiction\\nover the subject matter, Subsequently, two\\npersons were allowed to intervene who had\\nfailed the bar examination three times and\\nwere not allowed to take it for a fourth\\ntime under the provisions of Act No. 750.\\n\\nThe trial court observed the long history\\nof legislative enactments governing admis-\\nsion to the bar and the lack of any stand-\\nards adopted by the courts of Alabama and\\nconcluded that Act No. 750 was constitu-\\ntional. From this judgment the Board ap-\\npealed.\\n\\nIt-is the contention of the Attorney Gen-\\neral ‘and intervenors that the legislature\\nmay exercise regulation over bar examina-\\ntions if such regulation does not impair the\\njudicial branch’s exercise of its inherent\\nfunctions; that the legislature has done so\\nfor over fifty years; that the judiciary has\\nacquiesced in such regulation; and that the\\nBoard is a legislatively created authority\\nand not an arm of the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe Board submits that Act No. 750 vio-\\nlates Sections 42 and 43 of the Alabama\\nConstitution as an attempted exercise by\\nthe legislature of judicial functions and as\\nan invasion of the inherent powers of the\\njudiciary; that the legislature may estab-\\nlish only minimum standards for the prac-\\ntice of law; that the Board is an arm of\\nthe Supreme Court and its standards for\\nadmission are court-made rules. It also\\nargues that Act No. 750 is unconstitu-\\ntionally vague, uncertain, arbitrary, and ca-\\npricious.\\n\\nThe single issue presented by this appeal\\nis whether establishing rules governing ad-\\n\\nI, Section 189 of the Constitution of 1901 has\\nnow been superseded by Amendment 328 to\\nthe Constitution of 1901—proclaimed ratified\\n\\nmission to the bar is a judicial function\\nand, if so, is the legislature, by Act No.\\n750, exercising a judicial function in viola-\\ntion of. the admonitions and prohibitions\\ncontained in Sections 42 and 43 of the\\nConstitution of 1901.\\n\\nThese sections of the Constitution pro-\\nvide in part:\\n\\n“Section 42, The powers of the gov-\\nernment of the State of Alabama shall\\nbe divided into three distinct depart-\\n\\nments . . . legislative . . .\\nexecutive judicial 2.”\\n“Section 43. In the government of\\n\\nthis state, except in the instances in this\\nConstitution-hereinafter expressly direct-\\ned or permitted, the legislative depart-\\nment shall never exercise the executive\\nand judicial powers, or either of them\\n\\nThe Board of Commissioners of the Ala-\\nbama State Bar was created by Act No.\\n133, General Acts of Alabama 1923, page\\n100, approved August 9, 1923 (Code of Al-\\nabama 1940, Title 46, § 21). This act was\\nfound by this court to be constitutional in\\nEx parte Thompson, 228 Ala. 113, 152 So.\\n229 (1933). In that case, this court looked\\nto Section 139 of the Alabama Constitu-\\ntion, which provided:\\n\\n“The judicial power of the state shall\\nbe vested in the senate sitting as a court\\nof impeachment, a supreme court, circuit\\ncourts, chancery courts, courts of pro-\\nbate, such courts of law and equity in-\\nferior to the supreme court, and to con-\\nsist of not more than five members, as\\nthe legislature from time to time may es-\\ntablish, and such persons as may be by\\nlaw invested with powers of a judicial\\nnature .” (Emphasis added)\\n\\nThe court recognized that the powers\\nconferred on the Board were judicial in\\ncharacter, but concluded that under Section\\n\\nDecember 28, 1978. (See specifically Article ,\\nVI, § 6.01(a) and (b).)\\n\\n\\n139 of the Constitution there was express\\nauthority for creating the Board and con-\\nferring on it judicial functions. However,\\nthe court noted that “. the rules\\nand regulations which may be formulated\\nand adopted by the board shall not become\\neffective until the same shall have received\\nthe approval of this court, and the right of\\nthis court to approve or disapprove all or\\nany part of the rules so formulated and\\nadopted by the board is fully reserved to\\nthis court. . . .” (Emphasis Added)\\nEx parte Thompson, supra, at 124-25, 152\\nSo. at 238. And in this same opinion, at\\npage 126, 52 So. at page 240, referring to\\nthis court’s power and responsibility to ad-\\nmit and disbar attorneys, the court said\\nae This inherent power of the\\ncourt cannot be defeated by the legislative\\nor executive department. ad\\n\\nIt is true that this court has recog-\\nnized legislative power to prescribe mini-\\nmum requirements for admission to the bar\\nso long as they do not interfere with the\\ninherent power of the court to determine\\nwho shall practice before it. Ex parte Do-\\nzier, 262 Ala. 197, 77 So.2d 903 (1955).\\nBut the fact that this court has not been as\\nactive in formulating rules governing ad-\\nmission to the bar (as it has in adopting\\nrules governing the practice of law) but\\nrather has left this function largely to the\\nBoard of Bar Commissioners, acting on its\\nbehalf, does not mean that it has abrogated\\nits authority and responsibility to the legis-\\nlature, if in fact such power is inherent to\\nthe judiciary. In fact, it cannot relinquish\\nits authority to another branch of govern-\\nment under the express provisions of the\\nconstitution of this state.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia, respond-\\ning to a charge similar to the one made\\nhere, that judicial acquiescence in legisla~\\ntive activity in this area has diluted the\\ncourt’s inherent power, said that judicial\\nrecognition of such legislative acts did\\n“ not mean that this court intend-\\ned to, or even could, relinquish this judicial\\nresponsibility to the legislature.” Wallace\\n\\nv, Wallace, 225 Ga. 102, 111-12, 166 S.E.2d\\n718, 724 (1969).\\n\\nThis brings us to the question of wheth-\\ner regulation of admission to the bar is an\\n“inherent” power of the judiciary. It has\\nbeen said that “What constitutes judicial\\npower, within the meaning of the constitu-\\ntion, is to be determined in the light of the\\ncommon law and of the history of our in-\\nstitutions as they existed anterior to and at\\nthe time of the adoption of the constitu-\\ntion.” State v. Harmon, 31 Ohio St. 250,\\n258 (1877).\\n\\nA brief examination of the common-law\\nhistory of regulating admissions to the bar\\nand the practice of law reveals a division\\nof responsibilities in the English legal pro-\\nfession. In the early days of the profes-\\nsion there was the “attorney,” who served\\nas a substitute for the litigant and the “ad-\\nvocate” or “barrister” who supported one’s\\n“, . 4 cause by his learning, ingenuity\\nand zeal.” 2 W. Holdsworth, A History\\nof English Law 311 (4th ed. 1936). In\\n1292, Edward I decreed that admissions to\\nthe profession should be regulated and del-\\negated to his justices the task of appoint-\\ning as attorneys those with sufficient\\nlearning and skill. Rolls of Parliament, i.\\n84, cited in Vol. I, F. Pollock & F. W.\\nMaitland, The History of English Law\\n216, n. 2 (2d ed. 1898).\\n\\nBy 1403, the increasing number of attor-\\nneys forced Henry IV to order his justices\\nto examine all attorneys and put on the\\nroll only those with good character and\\nsufficient learning. 4 Henry IV, c. 18\\nSee also Lee, The Constitutional Power of\\nthe Courts Over Admission to the Bar, 13\\nHarv.L.Rev. 233 (1899). The courts also\\nissued orders regulating the conduct of the\\nprofession as evidenced by orders issued in\\n1452. Praxis Utriusque Banci 26, cited in\\n2 W. Holdsworth, A History of English\\nLaw 505, n. 3 (4th ed. 1936). While Par-\\nliament legislated in this regard with re-\\nspect to the numbers to be allowed admis-\\nsion as attorneys, Parliament did not at-\\ntempt to determine the amount of learning\\n\\n\\n106\\n\\nor qualifications to be required of an attor-\\nney. .\\n\\nThe barristers were also subject to court\\ncontrol, though some argue only indirectly.\\nSee Comment, Admission to the Bar and\\nthe Separation of Powers, 7 Utah L.Rev.\\n82 (1960-61), The barristers came from\\neducational societies called the Inns of\\nCourt. The barrister’s call to the bar\\ncame from the Inns of Court; how-\\never, if the Inns refused to call a person to\\nthe bar, the remedy was an appeal to the\\njudges. Lee, The Constitutional Powers of\\nthe Courts Over Admission to the Bar, su-\\npra, at 240.\\n\\nAdditionally, the judges regulated the\\nnumber of students admissible to the Inns\\n—and thus the number admissible to the\\nbar—the course of study, and even morals\\nand mode of dress. See Note, Legislative\\nor Judicial Control of Attorneys, 8 Ford-\\nham L.Rev. 103, 104 (1939): Indeed,\\nthere is speculation that the Inns were de-\\nveloped through the efforts of judges and\\nserjeants to improve the profession. Hold-\\nsworth, supra, at 496.\\n\\nTt has been observed “The English\\ncourts from time to time, by virtue of their\\nown rules, without any legislation, regulat-\\ned the admission and disbarment of attor-\\nneys.” Lee, The Constitutional Power of\\nthe Courts Over Admission to the Bar, su-\\npra, at 244,\\n\\nVarious rules adopted from 1573 to 1704\\ncan be found in Maugham on Attorneys,\\n15-20, App. XIV-XX (1825). Lee, supra,\\nat 244, Parliament legislated upon the\\nsubject, but the legislation was to exclude\\nthe unfit. The statutes always recognized\\nthe admission of attorneys as a matter of\\njudicial discretion. Lee, supra, quoting\\nMaugham, Attorneys and Solicitors 9\\n(1825).\\n\\nIt thus appears that “. although\\nthe profession had its origin and mature\\ndevelopment in a country where constitu-\\ntional divisions of government were un-\\n\\n-the judiciary, . .\\n\\nknown, its supervision and control at every\\nstage were handed over to the judges, until\\nby long continued use they came to consti-\\ntute recognized prerogatives belonging to\\n.” Green, The\\nCourts’ Power Over Admission and Dis-\\nbarment, 4 Tex.L.Rev. 1,7 (1925).\\n\\nIt is clear, therefore, that for several\\ncenturies, the English considered the regu-\\nlation of admission to practice before the\\ncourts to be a judicial function, exercisable\\nonly by the courts.\\n\\nIn this country, unlike England, it is a\\ncharacteristic of both the national and\\nstate governments to divide governmental\\nfunctions into three distinct, separate and\\nequal branches. One cannot read The\\nFederalist papers without being struck with\\nthe concern and attention which the fram-\\ners of our constitution devoted to the prin-\\nciple of separation of powers. It was\\nagreed by all “. that the legislative,\\nexecutive, and judiciary departments ought\\nto be separate and distinct.” The Federal-\\nist No. 47 (J. Madison).\\n\\nThomas Jefferson believed that concen-\\ntrating the powers of the three depart-\\nments in the same hands was “. . .\\nprecisely the definition of despotic govern-\\nment.” (Notes on the State of Virginia, p.\\n195, quoted in The Federalist No. 48 (J.\\nMadison). He said that that was not the\\nform of government for which this country\\nfought but rather “. one which\\nshould not only be founded on free princi-\\nples, but in which the powers of govern-\\nment should be so divided and balanced\\namong several bodies of magistracy, as\\nthat no one could transcend their legal lim-\\nits, without being effectually checked and\\nrestrained by the others. For this reason,\\nthat convention which passed the ordinance\\nof government, laid its foundation on this\\nbasis, that the legislative, executive and ju-\\ndiciary departments should be separate and\\ndistinct...”\\n\\nIn commenting on Jefferson’s draft of a\\nconstitution for Virginia, which like Alaba-\\n\\n\\nma’s, contains a provision for separation of\\npowers, the author of The Federalist No,\\n49 (Hamilton or Madison) said:\\n\\n“The plan [for three equal but sepa-\\nrate branches of government] . .\\nmarks a turn of thinking, original, com-\\nprehensive, and accurate; and is the\\nmore worthy of attention as it equally\\ndisplays a fervent attachment to republi-\\ncan government and an enlightened view\\nof the dangerous propensities which it\\nought tobe guarded, . . .”\\n\\nUnquestionably, the establishment of\\nthree separate but equal and independent\\nbranches of government was considered by\\nthe writers of the American Constitution\\nas essential to a republican form of gov-\\nernment, guaranteed to the states by Arti-\\ncle IV, Section 4, One writer has said\\nthat there are four essential characteristics\\nof a republican form of government.\\n\\n1) The existence of the ultimate sover-\\neignty in the body politic;\\n\\n2) The expression of the popular will by\\nthe method of representation;\\n\\n3) Subservience of the entire group to\\nthe will of the majority; and\\n\\n4) The independency of the executive,\\nlegislative, and judicial departments\\nof government. Ingham, Republic in\\nForm, 34 Dickinson L.Rev. 193\\n(1930).\\n\\nThe framers of the Constitution of the\\nUnited States believed that the real danger\\nin disturbing the system of checks and bal-\\nances provided for in the separation of the\\ngovernment into three equal branches was\\nthe danger of changing the form of gov-\\nernment to something other than the re-\\npublican form. This division of power,\\nand the system of checks and balances in-\\nherent in it, is said to be America’s chief\\ncontribution to the science of government.\\n\\n2. 1.

Act No. 750\\nremoves minimum standards established by\\nthe Board as an arm of this court.\\n\\nHE We have repeatedly held, as recent-\\nly as April 10, 1975, in Simpson’v. Ala-\\nbama State Bar, 294 Ala. 52, 311 So.2d\\n307, 309:\\n\\n“\\n\\n+. The Board was created in\\naid of this court, which has the inherent\\njuzisdiction to admit attorneys to the\\npractice of law and to suspend or disbar\\nthem, . . .”\\n\\nAlthough the Board was created by the.\\n\\nlegislature, it was created as an arm to this\\ncourt and any action by the Board is sub-\\nject to review or approval by this court.\\nThe legislature has not created an entity\\nwhich is not subject to’ control or regula-\\ntion, the Board is subject to the control of\\nthis court. Act No. 750 would dilute that\\ncontrol, and hence invades the judicial\\nsphere.\\n\\n+. . Each department, in our\\nbeautiful system of government, has its\\nown appropriate sphere, and so long as it\\nconfines itself to its own orbit the ma-\\nchinery of government moves without\\nfriction.” Petition of Splane, 123 Pa.St.\\n527, 540, 16 A. 481, 483 (1889).\\n\\nThis court is compelled, under our sys-\\ntem of government, to guard against such\\nencroachments by one branch of govern-\\nment into the sphere reserved to another\\nequal branch. We hold, therefore, that\\nAct No. 750 violates Sections 42 and 43 of\\nthe Constitution of 1901.\\n\\nThe intervenors and the attorney general\\npoint out, and it is not contested by the\\nBoard, that Rule [V(D) is not absolute, as\\nit now stands, and provides for examina-\\ntions in excess of three upon approval by\\nthe Board. The record shows that in the\\npast ten years three applicants have been\\npermitted to take the bar examination more\\nthan three times, upon a showing of “ex-\\n\\n‘traordinary, mitigating circumstances.” Of\\nthese three, only one applicant passed the\\nexamination. The intervenors complain of\\nthe absence of a specific written rule spell-\\ning out what constitutes “extraordinary,\\nmitigating circumstances.”\\n\\nApproximately two-thirds of the states\\nin this country provide for a limited num-\\nber of times which an applicant may stand\\nfor the bar examination. Many provide\\nfor three times, as does Alabama, Some\\nof these states, in allowing an additional\\nattempt, require approval of the various\\nboards, some require approval of the Su-\\npreme Court, and some require the passage\\nof time between the last permitted attempt\\nand any subsequent one which may be al-\\nlowed. Many require a showing of addi-\\ntional study as a condition to applying for\\npermission to take the examination in ex-\\ncess of the times permitted.\\n\\nI We are in agreement with the in-\\ntervenors that, whatever standards are\\nused to determine whether an applicant\\nshould be allowed to take the examination\\nin excess of three times, those standards\\nmust comport with equal protection and\\ndue process safeguards. The Supreme\\nCourt of the United States has said, “We\\nrecognize the importance of leaving States\\nfree to select their own bars, but it is\\nequally important that the State not exer-\\ncise this power in an arbitrary or discrimi-\\nnatory manner. .” Konigsberg v.\\nState Bar of California, 353 U.S. 252, 273,\\n77 S.Ct. 722, 733, 1 L.Ed.2d 810 (1957).\\n\\nHE However, these intervenors have\\nnot shown that the Board has acted arbi-\\ntrarily or discriminatorily in denying them\\npermission to take the bar examination in\\nexcess of three times, nor have they shown\\nany extraordinary or mitigating circum-\\nstances which would bring them within the\\nexisting criteria, as general as it is. They\\nbase their application to take the examina-\\ntion a fourth time squarely upon Act No.\\n750. That act is in violation of the Consti-\\ntution of Alabama. Therefore, the inter-\\n\\n\\n110\\n\\nvenors must, if they wish to persist in,\\ntheir efforts to gain permission to stand\\nfor the bar another time, show that some\\nmitigating circumstances exist which are\\nsufficient to persuade the Board, acting\\nwithout capriciousness or discrimination, to\\npermit them, or either of them, an addi-\\ntional examination,\\n\\n[J The Board, should the intervenors\\nor either of them apply for permission to\\ntake the bar examination another time,\\nmust determine upon the facts of each\\ncase, whether either or both intervenors\\nhave shown sufficient, extraordinary or\\nmitigating circumstances as to indicate that\\ncircumstances existed at the last three ex~\\naminations as to make it unlikely that the\\napplicant(s) has been fairly tested as to his\\ncompetency to practice law in this state, or\\nwhether subsequently the applicant(s) has\\nacquired additional training which would\\nrender him more likely to be successful in\\na fourth effort to meet the requirements\\nfor admission to the bar of this state, or\\nother good and valid reasons.\\n\\nThe judgment appealed from is reversed\\nand one is here rendered in favor of appel-\\nlant.\\n\\nReversed and rendered.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C. J., and MERRILL,\\nBLOODWORTH, FAULKNER, JONES,\\nALMON and EMBRY, JJ., concur.\\n\\nMADDOX, J., concurs specially.\\n\\nMADDOX, Justice (concurring special-\\nly.) .\\n\\nI concur . specifically in that portion of\\nthe majority opinion which holds that this\\nCourt has the inherent power to govern\\nadmission to the Bar.\\n\\nBy concurring specially, however, I do\\nnot wish to be understood as saying that I\\nbelieve that the policy expressed by the\\nlegislature of allowing an applicant to take\\nthe examination more than three times is\\n\\nnecessarily unreasonable. The applicants\\nhere, however, do bottom their right to\\ntake the examination the fourth time solely\\non the provisions of Act 750, and the Act\\ndoes, in fact, conflict with the Bar rule.\\nConsequently, it is my opinion that this\\nCourt must ultimately determine whether\\nthe Bar rule, or its application, denies an\\napplicant equal protection of the laws or\\ndue process.\\n\\nIf the majority opinion denied the appli-\\ncants the right to continue to show them-\\nselves qualified to practice law, I would\\nhave to disagree with that conclusion, But\\nsince the applicants are given an opportu-\\nnity to apply again to take the examina-\\ntion, the way is still open for them to test\\nnot only the rule, but also its application in\\ntheir individual cases, and it is my own\\npersonal opinion that if they are rejected,\\nthey may then petition this Court to review\\nthe matter in the same manner in which\\nwe review disciplinary proceedings. Cf.\\nEx parte Weinberg, 281 Ala. 200, 201 So.\\n2d 38 (1967).\\n\\nAnother reason why I concur specially is\\nthat I believe that the new Judicial Article,\\n(Amendment 328, Constitution of Alabama,\\n1901, carried as Article VI in Vol. I of\\nMichie’s Code of Alabama 1940, Recom-\\npiled 1958, 1973 Cumulative Supplement) is\\ncontrolling. In other words, the new Judi-\\ncial Article restructured the court system\\nand redistributed the “judicial power” of\\nthis state, and I believe that this case and\\nfuture cases must be governed by the Arti-\\ncle’s provisions.\\n\\nI also feel compelled to point out, gratu-\\nitously, I suppose, that I believe that these\\nintervenors have certain inalienable rights\\nand that one of these is the right to prac-\\ntice law, if they are qualified. Justice Col-\\nlier, In Matter of Dorsey, 7 Porter 293, 381\\n(1838), discussed the free choice of a citi-\\nzen to practice law if he so desires. He\\nwrote:\\n\\n“It may be again said, that there is no\\ndeprivation of life, liberty or property,\\n\\n\\n111\\n\\nconsequent on a refusal to take the oath.\\nI answer, that the law itself presumes\\nthe right to practice law, a valuable\\nright, as it confers it as a boon, on those\\nwho can, and are willing to take the\\noath. Can it be seriously contended, that\\nit is not a valuable right, and as deserv-\\ning of protection as property? Suppose\\nthe right to practice law, was confined\\nto a particular class or order of men, by\\nlaw, would it not be esteemed a most\\nvaluable privilege? And if the right of\\nentering this fraternity could be pur-\\nchased with money, would it not com-\\nmand a high price? I think there can\\nbe no doubt of it; and if so, exclusion\\nfrom it must be the privation of a valua-\\nble right; as worthy of the protection of\\nthe law, as property? I think, there-\\nfore, that in this view, the law in ques-\\ntion, is contrary to the spirit, the plain\\nintent, and meaning of that part of the\\ntenth section of the bill of rights, which\\nprovides, that ‘no one shall be deprived\\nof life, liberty, or property, but by due\\ncourse of law.’\\n\\n“I am also of opinion, that the act in\\nquestion, so far as it prescribes an ex-\\npurgatory oath, as a condition to the\\npractice of law in this State, (though\\npassed with the most laudable motives,)\\nis contrary to the very scope and design\\nof a free government. The most arbi-\\ntrary and vexatious inventions of tyran-\\nny, are those regulations of law, which\\ninterfere with the domestic concerns of\\nsociety, by preventing the citizen from\\nthe pursuit of happiness in his own\\nmode. The ‘pursuit of happiness’ is as-\\nserted in the Declaration of Independ-\\nence, to be an inherent right; and is\\npromulgated as a_ self-evident truth.\\nAnd certainly if that expression means\\nanything, it must include the right to se-\\nlect which of the various avocations or\\npursuits in life, a young man will engage\\nin; his future destiny, and his value to\\nthe State, as one of its members, de-\\nmands the utmost freedom of choice;\\nand it is, therefore, of the highest impor-\\n\\ntance, in a free government, that this\\nright of choice should not be impaired.\\n\\nI agree with Justice Collier, that any law\\nor rule must not unreasonably impair a cit-\\nizen’s right to make his choice of a profes-\\n\\nsion.\\n\\n324 So.2d 265\\nEllis L.

Garrett, Jr., Montgomery, for\\nappellees,\\n\\n113\\n\\nJONES, Justice.\\n\\nThis is an appeal from the denial of a\\npurchaser’s suit for specific performance\\nof a contract to convey land. We reverse\\nand remand.\\n\\nIn 1973, Ellis and Frances Bruner began\\nto negotiate with Clarence and Laura\\nHines for the sale of 15 acres of land\\nfronting the Mobile Highway in Montgom-\\nery County commonly known as Swann\\nTrailer Park. During these negotiations\\nHines, the seller, accompanied Bruner, the\\npurchaser, to the site of the property.\\nBruner pointed out the property he wanted.\\nBruner later showed Hines a rough plat of\\nthe land which had been drawn from a\\ntape measurement done by Bruner and his\\nwife. The tape measurement showed 366\\nfeet road frontage, but Bruner told Hines\\nthat was only an estimate and might vary\\nby 10 feet either way.\\n\\nIn August, 1973, the Bruners and the\\nHines executed a written conract for sale\\nof the 15 acres, The contract included the\\n“rough plat? done by Bruner and his wife,\\nbut the plat was understood by both parties\\nnot to be an exact description of the land,\\nThe contract provided that the purchaser\\nwould pay $15,000, of which $3,000 was a\\ndownpayment, furnish a survey of the land\\nby a registered civil engineer, and install a\\nfence along the surveyed line within 60\\ndays. The parties agreed that the descrip-\\ntion of the 15 acres as furnished by the\\nsurveyor would constitute the 15 acres con-\\ntracted to be purchased. Time was stipu-\\nlated to be of the essence,\\n\\n114\\n\\nShortly after the contract was signed,\\nBruner, the purchaser, employed a civil en-\\ngineer named Mr. Cleghorn to survey the\\nproperty. The Cleghorn survey was sub-\\nmitted to Hines’s attorney who rejected it\\nbecause Cleghorn’s certification had ex-\\npired.\\n\\nThe purchaser then hired a civil engi-\\nneer named Mr, Garrett to survey the\\nproperty. Because of a dispute about\\nworking conditions, the purchaser fired\\nGarrett before his survey was complete.\\n\\nFinally, the purchaser hired a civil engi-\\nneer named Mr. Blalock. Blalock’s certifi-\\ncation was in order and his survey was\\ncompleted and submitted within. the sixty-\\nday period provided by the contract.\\n\\nThe fence required by the contract was\\noriginally installed along the Cleghorn sur-\\nvey, but was later moved slightly to comply\\nwith the Blalock survey. The final survey\\nincluded 15.1 acres with 376.5 feet of road\\nfrontage. The purchaser offered the seller\\n$500 for the additional 0.1 acre.\\n\\nThe seller refused to convey, claiming\\nthat the buyer’s survey did not comply with\\nthe contract. This refusal, says the seller,\\ncan be supported by the doctrine of con-\\nstructive conditions of exchange. Since\\nthe contract required the buyer to furnish\\nthe survey before it required the seller to\\nconvey, the buyer’s survey was a condition\\nprecedent to the seller’s duty to convey.\\nThe seller contends further that the buyer\\nfailed to comply with the survey require-\\nment before the sixty-day period expired;\\ntherefore, his duty.to convey never became\\nenforceable,\\n\\nThe validity of the seller’s arguments de-\\npend upon two issues. First, did the survey\\nfurnished by the buyer constitute a breach\\nof his contractual obligations? Second, if\\nthe buyer did breach the contract, was his\\nbreach so material that it discharged the\\nseller’s duty to convey?\\n\\nOur inquiry into these issues must begin\\nwith the contractual language relating to\\n\\nthe survey. The contract identifies the\\n15-acre plot by a rough drawing which is\\nattached to the contract, but it stipulates\\nthat the exact description will be provided\\nby a survey which will be furnished sever-\\nal weeks after the formal agreement is\\nconsummated, The survey description is\\nthe description to be used in the deed and\\nthe purchase money mortgage. The con-\\ntract does not include the normal words of\\napproximation, such as, “15 acres more or\\nless.”\\n\\nHEM Words of approximation have le-\\ngal significance in Alabama, In the case\\nof Hodges v, Denny, 86 Ala. 226, 5 So, 492\\n(1888), this Court classified contracts for\\nthe sale of land into two categories—\\nsales of specific tracts and sales of speci-\\nfied quantities. Regarding specified quan-\\ntity sales, such as the sale in the instant\\ncase, the Court said’ that the words “more\\nor less” had the effect of qualifying the\\ncontractual description of the land to allow\\nfor small variances in quantity due to “er-\\nrors in surveys or variations in instru-\\nments.” The words of approximation\\nplace the risk of such small errors on both\\nparties in specific quantity sales and pre-\\nvent either party from obtaining an adjust-\\nment in the purchase price.\\n\\nHMMM The corollary of this rule is\\nfound in Bankhead v. Jackson, 257 Ala.\\n131, 57 So.2d 609 (1952), where the Court\\nsaid: “A contract of sale by the acre is\\none wherein a specified quantity is materi-\\nal. Under such a sale, the purchaser does\\nnot take the risk of any deficiency and the\\nvendor does not take the risk of any ex-\\ncess.”\\n\\nSince the Hines-Bruner contract includ-\\ned no words of approximation, we must\\nconclude, as the ‘Bankhead Court did, that\\nexact acreage is material. Thus, we inter-\\npret the survey provisions of the contract\\nto require the buyer to return a survey for\\nexactly 15 acres.. When the buyer fur-\\nnished a survey for 15.1 acres, he partially\\nbreached the contract.\\n\\n\\nHl Our finding that the buyer partially\\nbreached his contract brings us to the sec-\\nond issue, which is whether the seller was\\nthereby released from his duty to convey.\\nTo preclude the buyer from enforcing the\\nseller’s promise to convey, the seller must\\nestablish that the buyer’s breach was mate-\\nrial. Conversely stated, to enforce the sell-\\ner’s promise, the buyer must prove that the\\nsurvey he furnished substantially per-\\nformed his contractual obligations. The\\ntest for materiality of a partial breach is\\nset out in Western Union Telegraph Co. v.\\nTersheshee, 230 Ala. 239,.160 So. 233\\n(1935). In that case, the Court said:\\n\\n“. . . where there is a breach of a\\ndependent - covenant, a condition\\nprecedent, which goes to the whole con-\\nsideration of the contract, the injured\\nparty has a right to rescind and recover\\ndamages for a total -breach, But a\\nbreach of an independent covenant\\nwhich does not go to the whole consider-\\nation of a contract, but which is subordi-\\nnate and incidental to the main purpose,\\ndoes not constitute a breach of the entire\\ncontract or warrant its recission by the\\ninjured party, and his remedy for a\\nbreach is compensation for damages.”\\n\\nThe main purpose of the contract be-\\ntween Hines and Bruner is not to furnish\\na survey, it is to convey land. The survey\\nis incidental to the conveyance. The pivot-\\nal question, therefore, is whether the sur-\\nvey which Bruner furnished was so inaccu-\\nrate that it defeated the main purpose of\\nthe contract—the conveyance. We be-\\nlieve that the doctrine of substantial per-\\nformance is applicable to this problem.\\n\\nThe doctrine of substantial performance,\\nwhich is now most commonly associated\\nwith building construction contracts, was\\n\\n1. See also 8A Corbin on Contracts, § 701 at\\n312 (1960), and Senick v. Lucas, 284 Ma.\\n878, 199 A.2d 875 (1964), for other authority\\napplying the substantial performance doc-\\ntrine to land-sale cases,\\n\\n2. See generally, Calamari and Perillo, The\\nLaw of Contracts, § 157, at 248 (1970).\\n\\n115\\n\\nactually introduced in Anglo-American ju-\\nrisprudence in a land-sale case, Boone v.\\nEyre, 1 H.B1. 273, 126 Eng.Rep. 160, Note\\n(K.B.1777)2 This Court has said that\\n“substantial performance does not contem-\\nplate a full or exact performance in every\\nslight or unimportant detail, but perform-\\nance of all important parts.” Miles v.\\nMoore, 262 Ala. 441, 79 So.2d 432 (1955) ;\\nWilson v. Williams, 257 Ala. 445, 59 So.2d\\n616 (1952).\\n\\nHM In order to decide whether Bru-\\nner’s survey constituted substantial per-\\nformance of his contractual duties, it is\\nnecessary to analyze the policy considera~\\ntions behind the doctrine. The doctrine\\narose to mitigate the harsh results that\\ncould flow from constructive conditions of\\nexchange in those contracts which require\\none party to render performance before\\nthe other party’s reciprocal promise is en-\\nforceable. If constructive conditions had\\nto be literally performed, the party whose\\nduty is enforceable only after his promi-\\nsor’s performance is rendered would have\\nan absolute defense to an action on the\\ncontract whenever a trivial portion of his\\npromisor’s performance is incomplete.”\\n\\nA good example of how the doctrine of\\nsubstantial performance operates to pre-\\nvent such injustice is found in the building\\nconstruction situation, The doctrine is es-\\npecially useful in building contracts be-\\ncause of the difficulty of reproducing on\\nthe construction site the precise specifica-\\ntions of blue print drawings. Often com-\\nparable materials of different brands will\\nhave to be substituted for specified but\\nunobtainable brands, and foundation speci-\\nfications on drawings will bend somewhat\\nto the realities of pouring concrete+ If\\nthe owner’s duty to pay were strictly con-\\n\\n3. Jacob & Youngs v. Kent, 280 N.X. 239, 129\\nN.E. 889, 23 A.L.R. 1429 (1970).\\n\\n4, Kizziar v. Dollar, 268 F.2d 914 (10th Cir.\\n1959).\\n\\n\\n116\\n\\nditioned upon literal compliance with the\\ncontract, construction contractors would\\nrarely be paid because dissatisfied owners\\ncould usually point to some discrepancy be-\\ntween the contract specifications and the\\nfinished product. Under the substantial\\nperformance doctrine, the builder may be\\nheld liable in damages for any discrepancy,\\nbut if his performance substantially fulfills\\nthe main purpose of the contract, he can\\nenforce the owner’s promise to pay.\\n\\nMl There is an analogy between the\\nbuilding contract situation and the instant\\ncase. In the instant case, the seller reject-\\ned the buyer’s survey because it showed 10\\nfeet more road frontage than the rough\\nplat and contained 0.1 acre more area than\\nthe contract specified. A professional sur-\\nveyor testified at the trial that no two\\nsurveys of the same land will be identical.\\nHe also testified that the cost of obtaining\\na survey which would absolutely comply\\nwith the contract’s specifications would be\\nprohibitive, and that the custom in the sur-\\nveying profession is to accept as accurate\\nsurveys which do not exactly meet pre-\\nscribed acreage. When his testimony is\\nconsidered in light of the facts that the\\nrough plat’s road frontage was measured\\nwith a steel tape, not survey equipment,\\nand its recital of 15 acres was only the\\nbuyer’s best estimate, it is obvious that the\\nseller’s promise to convey should not be\\nstrictly conditioned upon the buyer’s duty\\nto furnish a survey identical to the rough\\nplat.\\n\\nIf the enforceability of the seller’s prom-\\nise were so conditioned, the seller could\\ncontinue to point out discrepancies in the\\nbuyer’s survey and put the buyer to tremen-\\ndous expense resurveying the land. The\\nfacts of this case indicate that the buyer\\nunder this contract, much like the builder\\nunder a construction contract, would be at\\nan unfair disadvantage if he were required\\nto fully and exactly perform all of his con-\\ntractual duties before he could enforce any\\nof his contractual rights.\\n\\nHH The question of substantial per-\\nformance is determined with reference to\\nthe existing facts and circumstances of\\neach case. Wilson v. Williams, supra;\\nGray v. Wood, 220 Ala. 587, 127 So. 148\\n(1930). In this case, since the survey was\\nincidental to the main purpose of the con-\\ntract, and since the surveying profession\\naccepts as accurate surveys with small de-\\nviations, we hold that the buyer substan-\\ntially performed his obligations under the\\ncontract when he furnished the Blalock\\nsurvey. Thus, the seller’s promise to con-\\nvey became enforceable within the 60-day\\ncontract period and the seller is now in de-\\nfault.\\n\\nThe doctrine of substantial performance\\nis a necessary inroad on the pure concept\\nof freedom of contracts. The doctrine\\nrecognizes countervailing interests of pri-\\nvate individuals and society; and, to some\\nextent, it sacrifices ‘the preciseness of the\\nindividual’s contractual expectations to so-\\nciety’s need for facilitating economic ex-\\nchange. This is not to say that the rule of\\nsubstantial performance constitutes a moral\\nor ethical compromise; rather, the wisdom\\nof its application adds legal efficacy to\\npromises by enforcing the essential pur-\\nposes of contracts and by eliminating trivi-\\nal excuses for nonperformance.\\n\\nBecause both the individual and societal\\ninterests are vital coordinates in a private\\nenterprise system, the compromise of full\\nperformance should be kept minimal, and\\ncompensation should be paid whenever a\\nparty’s bargained for exchange is not ful-\\nfilled. In this case, the seller bargained to\\nsell fifteen acres—no more, no less. We\\nhave held that the buyer’s survey for 15.1\\nacres, although it breached the contract, so\\nclosely approximated the, contract’s survey\\nrequirement that it constituted substantial\\nperformance. Such a holding, however,\\ndoes not mean that the seller must now\\nconvey 15.1 acres with 376 feet of road\\nfrontage for the original price of $15,000.\\nSubstantial performance of the survey re-\\n\\n\\nquirement must be distinguished from mod-\\nification of the contract to conform with\\nthe survey. The original terms of ex-\\nchange remain in force. °\\n\\nHoon remand, the trial Court should\\nreopen the case for a determination of the\\nboundary lines of the property to be con-\\nveyed. If the trial Court finds that the\\nbuyer’s survey is as accurate a description\\nof the property as practicable, the Court\\nshould determine the value of the addition-\\nal 0.1 acre and assess that amount against\\nthe buyer as damages for partial breach.\\nIf the trial Court finds that the buyer’s\\nsurvey is not as accurate as practicable,\\nthe Court should determine the most accu-\\nrate description and enter a decree for spe-\\ncific performance upon that description\\nalong with any sums of money which may\\nbe necessary to compensate either party\\nfor deviations from 15.0 acres.\\n\\nReversed and remanded.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Hagood\\nv. Goff, 208 Ala. 642, 95 So. 21 (1923).\\n\\nEmployer’s contention is basically two-\\nfold: .\\n\\n1. The 1947 amendment of § 312, elimi-\\nnating the express right to intervene, did\\nnot have the effect of proscribing inter-\\nvention,\\n\\n2. Rule 24, ARCP, either permits inter-\\nvention as a matter of right or vests in the\\ntrial court wide discretion in allowing in-\\ntervention which has not here been abused.\\n\\nTAs to the first contention, we agree\\nthat the 1947 amendment does not have the\\nlegal effect of prohibiting intervention;\\nrather, § 312, as amended, expressly retain-\\ning the right of reimbursement and omit-\\nting any reference to intervention, merely\\nrecognizes that the right to be reimbursed\\nis not dependent upon the right of inter-\\nvention.\\n\\nSince the compensation carrier’s right to\\nintervene is neither statutorily authorized,\\nnor statutorily prohibited, we look now to\\nRule 24,\\n\\nRule 24(a)(2)—Intervenition of Right—\\npermits a party to intervene “when the ap-\\nplicant claims an interest relating to the\\nproperty or transaction which is the sub-\\nject of the action and he is so situated that\\nthe disposition of the action may as a prac-\\ntical matter impair or impede his ability to\\nprotect that interest, unless the applicant’s\\ninterest is adequately represented by exist-\\ning parties.”\\n\\n120\\n\\nRule 24(b)(2)—Permissive Intervention\\n—permits a party to intervene “when an\\napplicant’s claim or defense and the main\\naction have a question of law or fact in\\ncommon. . In exercising its dis-\\ncretion the court shall consider whether\\nthe intervention will unduly delay or preju-\\ndice the adjudication of the rights of the\\noriginal parties.”\\n\\nWe believe there is a narrow field of op-\\neration under these two subsections of\\nRule 24 for discretionary permission to\\nintervene in third party actions under §\\n312. Therefore, we shall return momen-\\ntarily to a discussion of the guidelines for\\nthe exercise of this discretion applicable to\\nthe ordinary case.\\n\\nHM The extraordinary facts of the\\npresent case, however, constrain us to hold\\nthat there is no field of operation for the\\ndiscretionary allowance of intervention\\nwhere the insurance company, as here, rep-\\nresents the third party defendant and is\\nalso seeking, through intervention, status\\nas a party plaintiff. Such a patent conflict\\nof interest exists as to bar the right of\\nunencumbered intervention. The potential\\nfor collusion is so inherent as to preclude a\\nshowing to the contrary within the spirit\\nof Rule 24,\\n\\nThe appellee relies on Varney v. Taylor,\\n71 N.M. 444, 379 P.2d 84 (1963), where the\\nNew Mexico Supreme Court reversed a\\nlower court’s decision denying intervention\\nin a workmen’s compensation case to an\\ninsurance company situated exactly as Em-\\nployer’s Casualty is here. The reason giv-\\nen by the New Mexico Court was that un-\\nder the New Mexico Workmen’s Compen-\\nsation Act, the insurance company would\\nforfeit its right to reimbursement if it were\\nnot made a party plaintiff. Even in that\\ncase, the Court limited the right of inter-\\nvention by holding that “the intervention\\n\\n1. Seo also Fidelity & Casualty Oo. of New\\nYork v. Bedingfield, 60 So.2d 489 (Fla.1952)\\n\\nitself should not be made final until the\\nmain cause is ready for judgment, and, in\\nthe interim, that the insurance company is\\nprecluded from participating as a party\\nplaintiff.”\\n\\nSuch a result (i. e., limited or encum-\\nbered intervention precluding participation\\nas a party plaintiff) would have been prop-\\ner in this case. Under present Alabama\\nlaw, however, there is no compelling rea-\\nson to allow the insurance company to in-\\ntervene in order to be subrogated to the\\nemployee’s claim; and when, as in this\\ncase, it also insures the third party, unen-\\ncumbered intervention should be denied.\\nA similar result has been reached by sever-\\nal federal courts facing this problem. Gu-\\ntowitz v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 7 F.R.D.\\n147 (E.D.Pa.1946); Christon v. United\\nStates, 8 F.R.D, 327 (E.D.Pa.1947);\\nGreene v. Verven, 203 F.Supp. 607 (D.\\nConn,1962),1\\n\\nHE After disposing of the narrow issue\\ninvolved here, we now return to a discus-\\nsion of the guidelines for allowing inter-\\nvention in the ordinary workmen’s compen-\\nsation case brought under Tit, 26, § 312.\\nWorkmen’s compensation cases are unlike\\nthe normal Rule 24 situation. Ordinarily,\\nRule 24 anticipates potential future litiga-\\ntion brought by or involving the interve-\\nnor. The purpose of allowing intervention\\nin such cases is to discourage multiplicity\\nof litigation and to relieve the intervenor\\nfrom the possible prejudice of “stare deci-\\nsis in later litigation involving the same\\nquestions of law and fact to which the un-\\nsuccessful applicant for intervention is fi-\\nnally a party.” Committee Comments,\\nARCP, Rule 24. In the ordinary case,\\nRule 24 is to be liberally construed to al-\\nlow intervention. See Atlantis Develop-\\nment Corp. v. United States, 379 F.2d 818\\n(Sth Cir. 1967).\\n\\nand Harrison v. Ford Motor Oo., 370 Mich.\\n688, 122 N.W.2d 680 (1963).\\n\\n\\nIn the § 312 situation, however, no fu-\\nture litigation is contemplated The com-\\npensation carrier will be reimbursed from\\nthe employee’s judgment, if any, whether\\nor not it intervenes. Since the employee is\\nseeking exactly the same recovery as the\\ninsurer, the usual case will be resolved by\\nthe final clause of Rule 24(a)(2),“. . .\\nthe applicant’s interest is adequately repre-\\nsented by existing parties.”\\n\\nThus, in the § 312 case, the motives\\nfor liberally allowing intervention are ab-\\nsent and the right to intervene by the com-\\npensation carrier should be more restricted\\nthan in other Rule 24 cases. Before inter-\\nvention should be allowed over the objec-\\ntion of the plaintiff in a § 312 third party\\naction, the applicant must meet a burden of\\n\\nshowing to the satisfaction of the trial\\ncourt that he can make a substantial con-\\n\\ntribution toward a favorable outcome of\\nthe plaintiff-employee’s case.\\n\\nA mere showing that the applicant is the\\nemployer or his compensation carrier and\\nthe extent of its right of reimbursement is\\ninsufficient to meet this burden, If, on the\\nother hand, the applicant can demonstrate\\nactive participation in the preparation of\\nthe third party action; that it has in its\\npossession significant information or data\\nessential to the prosecution of the third\\nparty suit; or that the employee-plaintiff\\nis inadequately represented or otherwise\\nless likely to succeed in his effort to effect\\nrecovery without the intervenor’s active\\nparticipation; then, in such event unen-\\ncumbered intervention (i, e., full participa-\\ntion in the litigation) should be allowed.\\n\\nThis is not to say that a petition to in-\\ntervene in a § 312 third party suit, over\\nobjection and absent such showing, cannot\\nbe granted conditionally in order that the\\nintervention be made final at the time of\\n\\n2. The employer or the insurance carrier\\nis permitted by § 812 to bring suit only in the\\nevent the employee does not file suit against\\nthe third party within the time allowed by\\n\\n121\\n\\njudgment to protect the intervenor’s right\\nof reimbursement. Likewise, nothing in\\nthis opinion is to be construed as prevent-\\ning the interested parties from effecting\\nreimbursement by agreement with or with-\\nout active intervention.

We affirm.\\n\\nThis case began as a suit by The Bap-\\ntist Foundation to enjoin a continuing tres-\\npass to lands held by it under a testamen-\\ntary trust. In its petition, The Baptist\\nFoundation alleged that appellee Penn had\\ncrossed and was continuing to cross an old\\nroadway or trail on the Foundation’s lands\\nand was grading, scraping, and filling the\\nroadway to utilize it as access to a trailer\\npark Penn planned to build. Appellee Penn\\ndenied any trespass by asserting that the\\nroadway was the subject of a prescriptive\\neasement in favor of the general public.\\n\\nFollowing a lengthy hearing, the court\\nfound that the roadway in question had be-\\ncome a public roadway by prescription and\\ndenied the Foundation’s request for a tem-\\nporary injunction against Penn,\\n\\nPenn then filed a cross bill averring that\\nthe road in question was a public road by\\nprescription, seeking to enjoin the Founda-\\ntion from any interference with his right\\nto use the road and to improve it, and add-\\ning as parties various other owners of land\\nadjacent to the road.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of a hearing held to\\nconsider Penn’s cross bill, the court again\\nfound that the road in question is a public\\nroad, The court also found that Penn\\nwould suffer damages greater in kind and\\ndegree than that of the general public if\\nthe road were blocked or obstructed and\\ngranted Penn’s request for an injunction\\nenjoining the Foundation from obstructing\\nthe road, from which decree the Founda~\\ntion now appeals.\\n\\nThe Foundation contends that it made\\nout a prima facie case at the preliminary\\ninjunction hearing by establishing its ti-\\ntle to, and possession of, the land on which\\nthe road is situated, by establishing that\\nthe road lay entirely within its property,\\nby establishing that Penn did not have its\\n\\n\\n| 125\\nLe\\n\\npermission to change the character of the\\nroad, and by establishing that Penn did en-\\nter its land with road machinery, trucks,\\nand fill material. The Foundation further\\ncontends that, because Penn was the mov-\\ning party at the second hearing, Penn\\nbore the burden of affirmatively establish-\\ning a prescriptive right to use the road, as\\nwell as the burden of establishing Penn’s\\nindividual right to am injunction different\\nfrom the general public. It is the Founda-\\ntion’s contention that Penn did not meet\\nthese burdens.\\n\\nAlthough it is undisputed that the road-\\nway in question was never a road recog-\\nnized and maintained by the county, the\\nexact status of the existing roadway is the\\nsubject of much dispute.\\n\\nAccording to the Foundation, the road-\\nway in question was merely “a trail wind-\\ning across the property, heavily grown up\\nwith underbrush and small trees and impas-\\nsable by car.” Relying on the authority of\\nBenson v. Pickens County, 260 Ala. 436,\\n70 So.2d 647 (1954), the Foundation main-\\ntains that the rule is that the use of such\\na road is presumed to be permissive and\\nthat the party claiming an adverse use has\\nthe burden of proving it. It is insisted, in\\nbrief, that there is no evidence in the rec-\\nord of any use that was “adverse, hostile to\\nthe title of [The Baptist Foundation or its\\npredecessor in title], and under a claim of\\nright,” and that, to the contrary, the wit-\\nnesses conceded that all use of the roadway\\nwas with the assumed or express permis-\\nsion of the owner.\\n\\nAccording to Penn, the roadway is an\\nopen, well-defined road with a history of\\nat least 20 years of continuous public use.\\nUnder Penn’s version of the facts, the rule\\nof Benson is inapplicable and the rule of\\nAyers v. Stidham, 260 Ala. 390, 71 So.2d\\n95 (1954), is controlling.\\n\\nHI In Ayers this Court held that “an\\nopen, defined roadway, through reclaimed\\nland, in continuous use by the public as a\\nhighway without let or hindrance for a\\nperiod of twenty years becomes a public\\n\\nhighway by prescription. . . . [A] pre-\\nsumption of dedication or other appropria-\\ntion to a public use arises.” 260 Ala. at\\n392, 71 So.2d at 97. Moreover, once the\\nAyers presumption arises, the burden is\\nthen on the landowner to show that the\\nuse was permissive and that it was in rec-\\nognition of the landowner’s title and right\\nto possession. 260 Ala. at 392, 71 So.2d at\\n97.\\n\\nHMM Whether the rule of Ayers or\\nBenson is controlling in a particular case\\ndepends upon the character and use of the\\nroad in, question. Consequently, the pre-\\ncise question presently before this Court\\nin the instant case is whether there is evi-\\ndence in the record of the character and\\nuse of the road in question which will sup-\\nport the trial court’s decree under the\\nalyers standard. Unless such evidence is\\nlacking or the court’s findings are other-\\nwise “plainly and palpably erroneous and\\ncontrary to the great weight of the evi-\\ndence” -[Garrison v. Grayson, 284 Ala. 247,\\n249, 224 So.2d 606, 607 (1969)], the trial\\n\\ncourt’s decree must be affirmed. Having ©\\n\\naccorded the trial court’s determination a\\npresumption of correctness, we now affirm\\nthat determination on the basis that there\\nis sufficient evidence in the record to\\nsupport the trial court’s findings.\\n\\nHl To justify application of the Ayers\\nstandard, there must have been evidence\\nin the record which supported the conten-\\ntion that the road in question was of the\\n“open, defined” variety, “in continuous use\\nby the public as a highway . . . for\\n. twenty years.” Ayers, supra. Al-\\nthough the record included evidence to the\\ncontrary, it also included substantial evi-\\ndence that the road does meet the Ayers\\nrequirements. For example, several wit-\\nnesses testified that the road is “well-de-\\nfined,” that they have never known it to be\\nblocked, and that it has been in continuous\\nuse by the public for over 20 years.\\n\\nHl Of course, the weight and credibili-\\nty of witnesses is for the trial court’s de-\\ntermination. On this appeal, this Court\\n\\n\\n126\\n\\nmust determine whether the trial court’s\\ndecree is supported by the evidence. More-\\nover, the record reflects that many wit-\\nnesses, in response to questions, gave an-\\nswers which are meaningless to us since\\nwe did not see the pointing finger “(Indi-\\ncating)” or “right here” or “you see. (In-\\ndicating),” instances of which are replete\\nin the record. The trial judge was not so\\nlimited, Morris v. Morris, 290 Ala. 41, 273\\nSo.2d 203 (1973).\\n\\nWhether Penn sustained injury\\nsufficiently “different, not merely in de-\\ngree, but in kind from that suffered by the\\npublic at large” [Ayers, 260 Ala. at 892, 71\\nSo.2d at 98] as to justify the awarding of\\nan injunction, is another question which\\nmust be resolved by an examination of the\\nrecord. Although, upon an examination of\\nthe record, we find some evidence to the\\neffect that Penn had obtained some ac-\\ncess to his land by means of an easement\\nacross the private lands of another, such\\nevidence is inconclusive particularly in view\\nof the record’s numerous references to\\n“here,” “(Indicating),” etc. heretofore\\nreferred to. Moreover, there is evidence\\nthat this is the only direct access from his\\nproperty to a public road. This evidence\\nis sufficient to support the trial court’s de-\\ncree,\\n\\nThis Court has stated that it is “com-\\nmitted to the rule that if the obstruction\\nforces the owner of the land out of his di-\\nrect, public street or road into a circuitous\\nroute in his commerce and intercourse with\\nthe outside world, this is a special injury to\\nhim not suffered by the general inhabitants\\nof the state, county or city.” Purvis v.\\nBusey, 260 Ala. 373, 378, 71 So.2d 18, 22\\n(1954). Because Penn’s injury fits within\\nthe Purvis rule, the case for injunctive re-\\nlief is justified.\\n\\nTherefore, we hold that the trial court\\ndid not err in awarding the injunction or\\nin applying the Ayers standard.\\n\\nA final contention is made by the\\nFoundation that the existing public ease-\\n\\nment, if any, cannot be changed or enlarg-\\ned by Penn. We agree. See Lindsey v.\\nShaw, 210 Miss. 333, 49 So.2d 580 (1950) ;\\nMoss v. Vance, 288 Ala. 224, 259 So.2d 252\\n(1972). However, the evidence on this is-\\nsue was conflicting. There was sufficient\\nevidence for appellee Penn on this issue to\\nsupport the trial court’s decree.\\n\\nHaving considered all the contentions\\nof the Foundation, and finding no reversi-\\nble error in any of them, we have conclud-\\ned that the decree of the trial court should\\nbe affirmed,\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

For the\\nlicense year 1975 appellant was issued by\\nthe City of Homewood A “retail mer-\\nchant’s license” but his application for a\\n“retail off premise beer license” was de-\\nnied by the City of Homewood.\\n\\nThe amended complaint further stated:\\n\\n“5, Petitioner has purchased, and\\nthere has been issued to your Petitioner\\n\\nby the City of Homewood, Alabama,\\na retail merchant’s license for the year\\n1975 and your Petitioner applied for re-\\nnewal and issuance of a retail off prem-\\nise beer and off premise wine license for\\nthe year 1975 by the City of Home-\\nwood and that the same was refused by\\nthe City of Homewood on January 27,\\n1975, Petitioner is ready, willing and\\nable to pay these fees upon issuance of\\nthe license,\\n\\n“6.

We reverse and re-\\nmand.\\n\\n\\n133\\n\\nThe circumstances under which the in-\\nstant controversy arose had their origin in\\na meeting of the Board of City Commis-\\nsioners of Dothan on September 20, 1974.\\nAt that meeting, two resolutions were pass-\\ned which are significant for purposes of\\nthe instant appeal. Resolution No. 4852\\ncalls for the expansion of Dothan’s corpo-\\nrate limits through the annexation of a\\nland corridor contiguous to established\\nDothan corporate limits. At that time,\\nDothan’s city limits lay wholly within the\\nboundaries of Houston County. The land\\nannexed under Resolution No. 4852 lies\\nprimarily in Houston County but also in-\\ncludes a small area in Dale County, The\\nsecond resolution, Resolution No, 4854,\\ncalls for the annexation of land lying in\\nDale County, the bulk of which is com-\\nposed of land owned by the Dothan-Hous-\\n.ton County Airport Authority, a public\\ncorporation. No challenge was voiced to\\nthese proposed annexations until action\\nwas taken on the second resolution.\\n\\nThe annexation of Houston County ter-\\nritory, proposed under the first resolution,\\nwas pursued under the provisions of Tit.\\n37, § 137(1), Code of Alabama 1940\\n(Cum.Supp.1973), and became effective\\nupon publication on September 23, 1974, as\\nprovided under § 137(1). On September\\n25, 1974, the second resolution, No. 4854,\\nalso pursued under § 137(1), was filed\\nwith the Judge of Probate of Dale County.\\n(Under § 137(1) land contiguous to a city’s\\ncorporate limits, if it does not lie “within\\nthe corporate limits or police jurisdiction”\\nof another city, may be annexed\\n“Cw]henever all of the owners of proper-\\nty” to be annexed file a signed petition re-\\nquesting annexation and “the governing\\nbody [of the annexing city] adopts an or-\\ndinance assenting to the annexation\\n\\n. 2) On October 4, 1974, various\\nparties (hereinafter referred to as “oppo-\\nnents”) challenged the validity of Dothan’s\\nrequest for an annexation: the Dale Coun-\\nty Commission; the Town of Napier Field\\nand its Town Council; the Town of\\n\\nGrimes and its Town Council; and certain\\nresidents who are electors and property\\nowners of both towns, both counties, and\\nthe City of Dothan. Resident property\\nowners of Dothan were later joined as pe-\\ntitioners. Opponents filed a Petition to\\nDismiss Request for Calling of Annexation\\nElection,\\n\\nOn October 10, 1974, in response to an\\nobjection that part of the proposed annexa-\\ntion lies within the police jurisdiction of\\nthe town of Grimes and Napier Field,\\nDothan filed its Resolution No. 4870, su-\\nperseding the resolution filed earlier, i. e.,\\nResolution No. 4854. The effect of this\\naction was to abandon the attempt at an-\\nnexation under § 137(1), as proposed by\\nthe earlier resolution, No. 4854, and to sub-\\nstitute the annexation Resolution No. 4870,\\nunder the provisions of Tit. 37, § 138 et\\nseq. [Tit. 37, § 138 et seq., do not expressly\\nforbid a city’s annexation of property lying\\nwithin the police jurisdiction of some other\\ncity.]\\n\\nIn response to the challenges asserted\\nby opponents, Dothan filed a “Motion to\\nStrike Petition to Dismiss Request For\\nCalling of Annexation Election Or, In\\nthe Alternative, Motion to Discontinue\\nHearing.” In its motion to strike, Dothan\\ncontended, first, that the Judge of Pro-\\nbate’s duties under § 138 et seq. are purely\\nministerial and do not give him power to\\nconduct a hearing to consider the objec-\\ntions raised by opponents’ Petition to Dis-\\nmiss and, second, that none of the oppo-\\nnents have standing to challenge Dothan’s\\nrequest for the calling of an annexation\\nelection.\\n\\nAt the hearing, the Probate Court denied\\nDothan’s motion to strike and entered an\\norder dismissing Dothan’s request for an\\nannexation election. The Probate Court\\nbased its order on its findings that: (1) it\\nhad “the power, authority and jurisdiction\\nto consider Opponents’ challenge to the va~\\nlidity of Dothan’s request for\\n\\nan annexation election”; (2)\\n\\n\\n134\\n\\nDothan’s annexation of the Houston Coun-\\nty corridor was a sham and subterfuge\\nwhich does not satisfy the contiguity re-\\nquirement of Tit. 37, § 152 and, further-\\nmore, that the approximately 350-foot com-\\nmon boundary between the Houston Coun-\\nty annexation and the Dale County annex-\\nation does not satisfy the contiguity re-\\nquirement because the legislature intended,\\n“a substantial common boundary”; (3) the\\nproceedings whereby Dothan purportedly\\nannexed the Houston County corridor are\\nvoid, and, being invalidly annexed, the cor-\\nridor cannot be relied: upon to satisfy the\\ncontiguity requirement for annexation of\\nthe Dale County land; (4) the legislative\\nintent underlying Tit. 37, § 152, prohibits\\nannexation by one city of land lying within\\nthe police jurisdiction of any other city;\\nand (5) the annexation proposed by Doth-\\nan is in violation of the legislative intent\\nthat municipal annexations not destroy the\\nmunicipality’s conformity to “legal” and\\n“popular” notions of what constitutes a\\nmunicipality. [The court refers to the fol-\\nlowing factors as determinative of whether\\nan annexation violates the legislative in-\\ntent: configuration of the annexation, sub-\\nstantiality of the common boundary, num-\\nber of voters residing on the land proposed\\nto be annexed, existence of streets or roads\\nrunning through the proposed annexation\\nconnecting it to the city. The court point-\\ned out that only two persons would be\\nqualified to vote as residents of the land\\nproposed to be annexed and that there are\\nno roads or streets connecting Dothan and\\nthe proposed annexation.]\\n\\nDothan appeals on the grounds that the\\ncourt exceeded its authority: A. by requir-\\ning a “substantial common boundary” in\\nthe absence of any such express require-\\nment by the legislature; B. by ruling that\\na, municipality cannot annex territory with-\\nin the police jurisdiction of any other mu-\\nnicipality in a similar absence of express\\nlegislative directive; C. by determining the\\nHouston County annexation was void thus\\npermitting an impermissible collateral at-\\ntack; and, finally, D. by holding that the\\n\\nproposed annexation violated legislative in-\\ntent.\\n\\nWe agree with the City of Dothan that\\nthe Probate Court of Dale County erred to\\na reversal on each of these grounds.\\nSince a resolution of these issues is deter-\\nminative of this appeal, we see no need to\\nconsider any other contentions raised by\\nDothan. We now proceed to a discussion\\nof the aforementioned issues.\\n\\nA, The requirement of Tit. 37, §\\n152, is simply that the territory proposed to\\nbe annexed be “contiguous to the boundary\\nof the city at some point.” [Our empha-\\nsis.] The map and legal description ac-\\ncompanying Dothan’s resolution shows that\\nthere is approximately a 350-foot common\\nboundary between the territory proposed to\\nbe annexed and the city boundary. This,\\nwe hold, is ample satisfaction of the re-\\nquirement of “contiguity” under § 152, su-\\npra.\\n\\nThere is no requirement of “substantial\\ncommon boundary” as the Probate Court\\nseems to consider necessary. In the terms\\nof this statute, “contiguity” means a\\n“touching” at some point. State ex rel.\\nMilan v. Masters, 207 Ala. 324, 93 So. 14\\n(1922).\\n\\nTl 8. By the express terms of § 152,\\nCode, the property proposed to be annexed\\n“may extend to or around the boundary\\nline of any other city, but is not to em-\\nbrace any territory within the corporate\\nlimits of another city.” [Our emphasis.]\\nIt is self-evident that there is a clear di-\\ntinction between “corporate limits” and\\n“police jurisdiction.” See Tit. 37, § 9,\\nCode of Alabama 1940 for a definition of\\nthe latter term.\\n\\nIt would seem that had the legislature\\ndetermined to exclude territory within the\\npolice jurisdiction of one city from being\\nannexed by another, it would have been a\\nsimple matter to have so provided. Such\\n\\n\\n135\\n\\nwas the legislative purpose as expressed in\\nTit. 37, § 137(1) [another annexation stat-\\nute] wherein it is expressly provided that\\nproperty to be annexed within that provi-\\nsion “not lie within the corporate limits or\\npolice jurisdiction of any other municipali-\\nty.” See our recent decision, State ex rel.\\nCity of Birmingham v. Tarrant City, 294\\nAla. 304, 315 So.2d 583 (1975), construing\\nthis section. There, this Court suggested\\nthat the section does not permit annexation\\nunder this statute in cases of overlapping\\npolice jurisdictions. In these cases, the\\nCourt added, “annexations must follow\\nconventional procedures.”\\n\\nHC. In determining that the Hous-\\nton County annexation was void, the Pro-\\nbate Court of Dale County erred as this\\nconstituted an impermissible collateral at-\\ntack thereon,\\n\\nAlthough admitting their attack is collat-\\neral rather than direct, opponents argue\\nthat the annexation proceedings in Hous-\\nton County were “void” not merely “voida-\\nble,” and therefore subject to attack in a\\ncollateral proceeding. We think the pro-\\nceedings were not “void.” Alexander v.\\nNelson, 42 Ala. 462 (1868). “[T]he law\\ndoes not favor collateral attack on a mu-\\nnicipal corporation in the exercise of [its]\\npolice powers . . ..” Chadwick v.\\nTown of Hammondville, 270 Ala. 618, 622\\n120 So.2d 899, 902 (1960). Being at most\\n“voidable” merely, opponents’ remedy\\nwould seem to be, as Dothan suggests, a\\ndirect attack in a court of general jurisdic-\\ntion,\\n\\nI OD. The Probate Court also held\\nthat the annexation was void because its\\nirregular shape and its lack of homogenei-\\nty with the rest of the city constitutes a vi-\\nolation of the legislative intent.\\n\\nWe know of no statutory mandate that\\nthe municipal boundaries of all territories\\nsought to be annexed must form a regular\\n\\nshape. Tit. 37, § 135(10) does require that\\nsuch annexed territory “form a homoge-\\nneous part of the city or town.” But, this\\nis not to imply that homogeneity demands\\nregularity of shape of the boundaries of\\nthe municipality. “Homogeneous” is de-\\nfined as “of a similar kind or nature\\n. of uniform structure or composi-\\n\\nconsisting of uniform ele-\\nments (as of people or groups with similar\\nbackground) . . ..” Webster\\'s Third\\nNew International Dictionary, 1966.\\n\\ntion\\n\\nHad the legislature been so disposed as\\nto require all muinicipalities to possess\\nboundaries of uniform and regular width\\nand length it might have said so.\\n\\nOther jurisdictions have permitted corri-\\ndors and irregularly shaped boundaries\\nsuch as those in the instant case. See\\nTovey v. City of Charleston, 237 S.C. 475,\\n117 S.E.2d 872 (1961); People v. City of\\nPalm Springs, 51 Cal.2d 38, 331 P.2d 4\\n(1958); City of Burlingame v. San Mateo\\nCounty, 90 Cal.App.2d 705, 203 P.2d 807\\n(1949). :\\n\\nClearly, the proposed annexation is no\\nsham or subterfuge because the City of\\nDothan has a valid municipal interest in its\\nown municipal airport.\\n\\n‘Therefore, we have concluded that there\\nis no violation of the legislative intent in\\nthe proposed annexation.\\n\\nHaving then concluded that the Probate\\nCourt of Dale County erred in holding that\\nDothan’s request for the calling of an an-\\nnexation election is invalid and erred in\\ndismissing the request, we reverse and re-\\nmand for the entry of a judgment in con-\\nformity with this opinion.\\n\\nReversed and remanded with instruc-\\ntions.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C, J., and FAULKNER, AL-\\nMON and EMBRY, JJ., concur.\\n\\n\\n325 So.2d 133\\n\\nBIRMINGHAM TRUST NATIONAL BANK,\\na corporation\\n\\nv.\\nMIDFIELD PARK, INC.\\nSC 1069.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nJan, 2, 1976.\\n\\n—_+—.\\n\\nRomaine S, Scott, Jr., Birmingham, for\\nappellant.\\n\\n\\nStone, Patton & Kierce, Bessemer, for\\nappellee,\\n\\nMERRILL, Justice.\\n\\nThis appeal is from a judgment in a de-\\nclaratory judgment proceeding wherein\\nMidfield Park, Inc. (hereinafter Midfield)\\nsought a construction of an agreement be-\\ntween it and Birmingham Trust National\\nBank (hereinafter BTNB).\\n\\nThe trial court’s construction of the\\nagreement resulted in its issuance of an in-\\njunction forbidding BTNB from maintain-\\ning a curb along the eastern boundary of\\nits property, and BT\\'NB appealed.\\n\\nThe only issue before this court is\\nwhether the trial court correctly construed\\nthe agreement. This agreement, dated No-\\nvember 9, 1969, was delivered by Midfield\\nto BTNB simultaneously with a deed of a\\nparcel of land to BTNB. The deed de-\\nscribed land consisting of 100 feet square\\nlocated in the Midfield Shopping Center,\\nMidfield, Alabama, upon which appellant\\nwas to construct a branch bank, The\\nagreement, drawn at the suggestion of\\nBTNB, governed the use of certain aspects\\nof the property. We are concerned here\\nspecifically with the aspects of ingress and\\negress, The agreement, in pertinent part,\\nprovides as follows:\\n\\n“(1) Upon the completion of the im-\\nprovements on Parcel B, [BTNB prop-\\nerty] and for and during the period of\\nyears thereafter as said Parcel A [Mid-\\nfield property] shall be used for shop-\\nping center purposes and said Parcel B\\n\\n\\n138\\n\\nshall be used for banking purposes, the\\nparties hereto give and grant to the oth-\\ner, and to their respective successors, as-\\nsigns, lessees, employees, invitees and\\ncustomers, the right of ingress to and\\negress from all public roads over and\\nacross the respective portions of Par-\\ncel[s] A and B which are set aside for\\ningress and egress generally, it being the\\nintention of the parties that said parcels,\\nwhich are contiguous, shall not be fenced\\nor otherwise used in such manner as will\\ninterfere with the free flow of automo-\\nbile traffic to and from their respective\\nparcels and the surrounding roads and\\nshopping center area, * * *” The trial\\njudge found as follows:\\n\\n“A drive-in window was incorporated\\nin the bank building when it was origi-\\nnally constructed. In March or April,\\n1969, an additional drive-in facility was\\nconstructed on the bank’s property, at\\nwhich time a curb was constructed along\\nthe easterly side of the bank’s land\\nwhich was contiguous to the land of the\\nplaintiff [Midfield]. Prior to the erec-\\ntion of the curb, a southerly portion of\\nParcel B was used for ingress and\\negress by plaintiff and its employees, in-\\nvitees and customers to and from: the\\npublic roads, and to said Parcels A and\\nB, which use thereof terminated upon the\\nerection of such curb.”\\n\\nBased on that finding of fact, the trial\\ncourt concluded that the action of BTNB\\nwas in contravention of the pertinent pro-\\nvisions of the agreement and the court en-\\njoined BTNB from maintaining the curb\\nalong the eastern boundary of its property.\\nWe affirm, .\\n\\nHH t is the duty of the court to “‘ana-\\nlyze and determine the meaning of a con-\\ntract * * * when its terms are clear\\nand certain * * * !” Metager Broth-\\ners, Inc. v.

We find\\nfrom the record in the lower court that\\neach party agreed and intended to be so\\nbound from their mutual benefit. BTNB\\nnoted in its counterclaim filed in circuit\\ncourt that it wished to protect the rights of\\ningress and egress from the bank area to\\nthe shopping center. It feared that Mid-\\nfield would isolate the bank from the con-\\nvenient flow of traffic by fencing it out of\\nthe shopping center, or other like measure.\\nMidfield consented to the agreement be-\\ncause it derived benefits also, As stated in\\nBTNB’s counterclaim “* * * the re-\\nspective parties could utilize their respec-\\ntive properties in the most effective and\\nefficient manner * * *” if this access .\\nwere available to each party. We can only\\nconclude, as did the lower court, that the\\nplain meaning of the agreement and the in-\\ntent of the parties warrant the injunction\\nagainst appellant. .\\n\\nHI Should there be any doubt as to the\\nplain meaning of the agreement, this court\\nwill go further to apply an old rule of con-\\ntract law, long recognized in this jurisdic-\\ntion. It was stated by this court most ef-\\nfectively in Alabama-Tennessee Natural\\nGas Co. v. City of Huntsville, 275 Ala. 184,\\n153 So.2d 619:\\n\\n“* * %* courts will construe doubtful\\nterms in a contract more strongly\\nagainst the party who framed or -pre-\\npared them, and when the instrument is\\ncapable of two constructions, it should\\nreceive that which is most unfavorable\\nto the maker. King v. Capitol Amuse-\\nment Co., 222 Ala. 115, 130 So. 799;\\nMinge v. Green, 176 Ala. 343, 58 So.\\n\\n\\n381; Livingston v. Arrington, 28 Ala.\\n424.”\\n\\nIt is clear from the record that BTNB pre-\\npared the agreement in question and the\\ningress and egress provision was included\\nin it at BTNB’s insistence, Therefore, as-\\nsuming any part of the agreement perti-\\nnent to this controversy had been found\\nambiguous or of doubtful meaning, that\\nmeaning would have been construed more\\nstrongly against BTNB, authorities supra.\\nAffirmed,\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Barber, as judge of\\n.the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Al-\\nabama, to vacate an order entered by him\\non the second day of May, 1975, striking a\\njury demand made by Calloway on a coun-\\nter-claim filed by Calloway in a pending\\ncourt action,\\n\\nOn April 30, 1974, Steven D. Pugh filed\\nan action against Calloway in which he\\nsought an injunction against Calloway\\nfrom going upon a certain piece of land\\nadjacent to a building Pugh had rented,\\nand later purchased. The land involved is\\na small area approximately 15’ x 30’ at the\\nrear of Pugh’s building which Pugh con-\\ntended served the building in numerous\\nways.\\n\\nPugh contended in his complaint that he\\nand his predecessors in title were then and\\nhad been in “actual physical possession of\\nthe real property described in the com-\\nplaint and that by virtue of adverse posses-\\nsion, and/or prescription, he was the owner\\nof the property,\\n\\nOn the same date that the original com-\\nplaint was filed, Judge Barber entered a\\ntemporary restraining order enjoining the\\npetitioners from going upon the land, or\\ncausing any agent or other person from\\ngoing upon the land. Calloway entered an\\ninitial appearance by filing an answer to\\nthe complaint and a counter-claim. The\\ncounter-claim contains two counts. Count\\none is an action for statutory ejectment;\\ncount two is a trespass action seeking mon-\\ney damages and injunctive relief. At the\\ntime the petitioners filed their answer and\\ncounter-claim, a jury trial was demanded.\\nOn April 30, 1975, Pugh filed a motion to\\nstrike the petitioner’s jury demand. Judge\\nBarber granted the motion to strike the\\njury demand and entered the following or-\\nder:\\n\\n“ORDER\\n\\n“This cause came on to be heard upon\\n‘Motion To Strike Jury Demand’ as filed\\non May 2, 1975 Plaintiff-Cross-Defend-\\nant.\\n\\n“The Court heard statements and ar-\\nguments of counsel and was furnished\\nwith legal authorities for the position\\ntaken by them in furtherance of an op-\\nposition to the said Motion. The Court\\nfinds that the basic issue in this cause is\\nthat of the ownership of the subject real\\nproperty. Plaintiff claims title to the\\n\\nsubject property by virtue of a prescrip-\\ntive right established by user. Defend-\\nants, in their counter-claim, claim owner-\\nship of the property and plead in ejéct-\\nment and seek damages for trespass.\\n\\n“Accordingly, it is CONSIDERED,\\nORDERED, ADJUDGED and DE-\\nCREED by the Court as follows:\\n\\n“ONE: A trial of the right of the\\nownership of the subject property will\\nclarify and make solid the rights of the\\nrespective parties to proceed further\\nwith their respective claims. For the de-\\ntermination of this basic question of law,\\nthat is the question of ownership, the\\nCourt does not desire a jury and the De-\\nfendants-Counter-Claimants are not enti-\\ntled, under the law, to a jury as to this\\nquestion. Therefore, the Court will pro-\\nceed to a determination, without a jury,\\nof the question of ownership and right\\nto possession of the subject property.\\nThe Court reserves the jury question as\\nto the other features presented in the\\npleadings.\\n\\n“DONE and ORDERED this 2nd day\\nof May, 1975.\\n\\n“/S/ W.C. Barber\\nCIRCUIT JUDGE IN EQUITY\\nSITTING”\\n\\nHMMM Petitioners then filed for manda-\\nmus in this Court. This Court ordered\\nJudge Barber to show cause why he should\\nnot vacate his order striking the jury de-\\nmand, Judge Barber argues that the peti-\\ntioners were not entitled to a jury trial be-\\ncause:\\n\\n1. In equity, a party is not entitled, as\\nof right, to a jury to decide the issues of\\nfact unless it is so provided by statute or\\nconstitution ;\\n\\n141\\n\\n2. There is no right to a jury trial in\\nan equity suit involving a subject matter of\\nadverse possession ;\\n\\n3. Where a plaintiffs claim is equitable\\nin nature, there is no right to a jury trial.\\n\\nWhile Judge Barber’s propositions of\\nlaw are accurate statements, we determine\\nthat they are inapplicable to this case. As\\nthe trial judge correctly pointed out in his\\norder, the pivotal question in this case is\\none of ownership of the disputed parcel.\\nThis cause has some similarity to the case\\nof Kelley v. Mashburn, 286 Ala. 7, 236 So.\\n2d 326 (1970).\\n\\nThere this Court said:\\n\\n“[1] Ejectment is a favored action for\\nthe trial of title to land. McCormick v.\\nMcCormick, 221 Ala. 606, 130 So. 226,\\n\\n“[2] Ejectment was known to the\\ncommon law, Betz v.

Rout Hudson and cer-\\ntain fictitious persons for libel claiming\\n$100,000 damages. The complaint charged\\nthat defendants falsely and maliciously\\npublished, or caused to be published, an ad-\\nvertisement in THE MOBILE PRESS\\nREGISTER on Sunday, October 13, 1974,\\nof and concerning the plaintiff, and with\\n\\n. intent to defame plaintiff, the following\\npart of said ad being in large, conspicuous\\nprint:\\n\\n“RALPH LOVELESS CANDIDATE\\nFOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY\\nFACES FRAUD CHARGES!”\\n\\n“The voters of Mobile County should in-\\nsist that Loveless withdraw from the\\nrace,”\\n\\n“Pd, Pol. Adv. by M. Rout Hudson, Mo-\\nbile, Ala.”\\n\\nA copy of the entire article is attached to\\nthe complaint. A copy hereinafter ap-\\npears, °\\n\\nPlaintiff alleges that the article by innu-\\nendo stated plaintiff was facing criminal\\nprosecution for fraud, which statement was\\nand is false. Plaintiff further avers “That\\nthe natural and probable implication from\\nthe article in the minds of the average lay\\n\\nGraddick was the successful candidate.\\n\\nEE 145\\nLe\\nreader was that the Plaintiff was presently of damage to reputation and standing in\\nbeing prosecuted for criminal fraud which the community, etc. The advertisement is\\nwas and is false” Then follow averments as follows:\\n\\n\\n146\\n\\nA motion for leave to depose defendant\\nGraddick before the election was denied.\\n[Graddick’s deposition was ultimately tak-\\nen January 21, 1975.] Graddick’s motion\\nto dismiss the complaint was likewise de-\\nnied, After several requests for admis-\\nsions by defendants and answers thereto by\\nplaintiff, defendants filed answer: denying\\nthe article is libelous per se or per quod;\\npleading truth as a defense; pleading priv-\\nilege; and, pleading the absence of malice\\nwithin the ambit of New York Times v.\\nSullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.\\nEd.2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412 (1964). The\\ndefendants moved for summary judgment.\\nA response to the motion for summary\\njudgment was filed by plaintiff.\\n\\nOn April 11, 1975, motion for summary\\njudgment was granted and the complaint\\ndismissed with prejudice. Hence, this ap-\\npeal.\\n\\nThe motion for summary judgment is\\nsupported by pleadings and exhibits, re-\\nquests for admissions and answers thereto,\\ndeposition of defendant Graddick, an affi-\\ndavit by Graddick and an affidavit by\\nplaintiff Loveless.\\n\\nFrom these documents it appears that\\ndefendant Graddick: does not recall who\\nrequested information regarding the suit\\nfrom the Chattanooga, Tennessee, Chan-\\ncery Court; denies he was concerned that\\nthe article was libelous but admits that he\\nconsulted with five lawyers before running\\nit; states he had no knowledge of any\\npending criminal charges of fraud against\\nplaintiff; states he doesn’t know if the\\ncharges are true or not—all he knows is\\nthat the charges are presently pending;\\nstates he left it to the voters to decide on\\nNovember 5th (the election date) whether\\nthey thought plaintiff should withdraw\\nfrom the race by voting for him (Grad-\\ndick); denies that he intended to imply\\nthat plaintiff had done something wrong;\\nstates it did not occur to him that lay peo-\\nple would read the headlines and get the\\nidea that plaintiff was facing criminal\\nfraud charges; denies intending to hurt\\n\\nplaintiff by publishing the article; states\\nhe published it “to inform the people of\\nMobile County of the man’s situation in\\nTennessee, going toward, again, his integ-\\nrity”; states he had no knowledge that any\\ninformation contained in the ad was false;\\nstates he published the ad in good faith\\nsolely to inform the electorate of the back-\\nground of one of its candidates.\\n\\nIt further appears from the admissions\\nof fact: that the paragraph in the com-\\nplaint “7 Alabamians are Defendants in\\nCivil Suit” and photocopy of such article is\\na genuine photocopy of an article appear-\\ning in THE MOBILE PRESS-REGIS-\\nTER on March 23, 1972; that the plaintiff\\nwas a party cross-defendant in the suit in\\nChancery Court in Chattanooga, Tennes-\\nsee, and, that the “Amendment to Cross-\\nclaim,” in that suit, alleges, inter alia, that\\nplaintiff and certain others had perpetrated\\na fraud upon the cross-plaintiff in the suit.\\n\\nPlaintiff-Loveless contends on this ap-\\npeal that the trial judge erred in granting\\nsummary judgment because:\\n\\nFirst, there is a genuine issue as to a\\nmaterial fact—namely, the interpretation to\\nbe placed on the “headline” and the entire\\narticle by the average lay reader as to\\nwhether it imports a criminal charge of\\nfraud;\\n\\nSecond, there is a genuine issue as to a\\nmaterial fact—whether the article is true\\nin “all material respects since the headline,\\nand the article as a whole, may be said to\\nimpute” that Loveless was facing criminal\\nfraud charges;\\n\\nThird, the “privilege” of New York\\nTimes v. Sullivan would be inapplicable if\\nplaintiff-Loveless had been permitted to\\nshow “actual malice” to the jury and\\ngranting summary judgment is inappropri-\\nate to dispose of these issues.\\n\\nDefendants-Graddick and Hudson an-\\nswer these contentions, thusly :\\n\\nFirst, “truth” is a complete defense, All\\nthe documents reveal that all the material\\n\\n\\nwhich went into the ad was, in fact, true\\n—nothing implied Loveless was facing\\ncriminal charges—Loveless himself admit-\\nted being a defendant in the pending law-\\nsuit wherein he, and others, were charged\\nwith fraud—thus, there was no genuine is-\\nsue as to any material fact;\\n\\nSecond, the ad showed on its face that\\nthe charges were “civil” and Loveless can-\\nnot enlarge on the plain meaning of the\\nwords, by innuendo or implication, beyond\\ntheir natural and obvious import ;\\n\\nThird, there is the issue of the constitu-\\ntional “privilege” under New York Times\\nv. Sullivan. Loveless and Graddick were\\ncandidates for District Attorney, and as\\nsuch, fall within the ambit of the “Times\\nRule” that public officials cannot recover\\nfor libel unless proof is offered that the\\npublication was made with “actual malice”\\n—“that is, with knowledge that it was false\\nor with reckless disregard of whether it\\nwas false or not.” It is contended by de-\\nfendants—Graddick and Hudson that all\\nthe evidence offered on summary judgment\\nis uncontradicted and is to the effect that\\ndefendants neither knew that any of the\\nmatter published was false nor did they\\nrecklessly disregard any matter of fact\\ncoming to their attention concerning the\\nmaterial used in the ad. Defendants con-\\nclude that there is not a scintilla of evi-\\ndence to warrant the case going to a jury.\\n\\nHaving set out the contentions of the\\nparties, we move to consider the funda-\\nmental issue presented to us by this appeal\\nas to whether there is a genuine issue as to\\nany material fact under Rule 56, A.R.C.P.,\\nSummary Judgment. Put differently, was\\nsummary judgment appropriate?\\n\\nIn order to determine this issue we must\\nfirst consider the following threshold ques-\\ntions,\\n\\nFirst, may the ad be said to “impute”\\ncriminal fraud, and, if so, is there then\\npresented a genuine issue on any material\\nfact?\\n\\n147\\n\\nSecond, assuming, arguendo, that the ad\\ndoes impute criminal fraud, nevertheless,\\ndoes this case fall within the “privilege” of\\nNew York Times v. Sullivan and, absent\\nan allegation or showing of actual malice,\\nis there then presented a genuine issue as\\nto any material fact?\\n\\nIt is appropriate that we set out those\\nbasic principles which govern us in our re-\\nview of the granting of summary judg-\\nment.\\n\\nHM The party moving for summary\\njudgment must clearly show, ie., has the\\nburden to show, that the other party could\\nnot recover “under any discernible circum-\\nstances.” Folmar v. Montgomery Fair\\nCompany, Inc., 293 Ala. 686, 309 So.2d 818\\n(1975); see also, Ray v. Midfield Park,\\nInc., 293 Ala. 609, 308 So.2d 686 (1975).\\n\\nHl A motion for summary judgment\\nmay be granted only when there is no gen-\\nuine issue as to a material fact and the\\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter\\nof law. Birmingham Television Corpora-\\ntion v. Water Works, 292 Ala. 147, 290\\nSo.2d 636 (1974).\\n\\nHI The moving party has “the burden\\nof showing the absence of a genuine issue\\nas to any material fact, and for these pur-\\nposes the material it lodged must be viewed\\nin the light most favorable to the opposing\\nparty.” Adickes v. Kress & Co., 398 U.S.\\n144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970).\\n\\nHB Likewise, we consider the “Scintilla\\nRule” in connection with summary judg-\\nment, We held in Folmar v. Montgomery\\nFair Company, Inc., supra, that if there is\\na scintilla of evidence produced in plain-\\ntiff\\'s favor on the issue of defendant’s\\nnegligence, then summary judgment will\\nnot lie, As the majority of this Court\\n\\npointed out therein, the plaintiff might es-\\ncape having summary judgment rendered\\nagainst him, yet still suffer the ignomy of\\ndefeat by way of directed verdict.\\n\\n\\n148\\n\\nHM To return now to the question first\\nposed as to whether summary judgment\\nwas appropriate, we answer in the nega-\\ntive. We are convinced that there are two\\ngenuine issues of material fact: first,\\nwhether the ad may be said to charge\\ncriminal fraud; and, second, whether, as-\\nsuming the applicability of the Times Rule,\\nthere is a sufficient showing of “actual\\nmalice.”\\n\\nHit seems to be the general rule that\\nthe test to be applied in determining the\\ndefamatory nature of an imputation is that\\nmeaning which “would be ascribed to the\\nlanguage by a reader or listener of ordi-\\nnary or average intelligence, or by a ‘com-\\nmon mind’.” 50 Am.Jur.2d Libel and Slan-\\nder § 138. Thus, in construing newspaper\\nads it “must be construed in the sense\\nwhich readers of common and reasonable\\nunderstanding would ascribe to it.” 50\\nAm.Jur, Libel and Slander, supra.\\n\\nOther authorities state, viz:\\n\\n“Words should be construed according\\nto their plain and obvious meaning. The\\nconstruction a court should adopt is to\\nbe derived from the expressions used, as\\nfrom the whole scope and apparent ob-\\nject of the writer. It is the manner in\\nwhich they will be most probably under-\\nstood. Words are to be understood in\\ntheir plain and popular sense, in court as\\nelsewhere. Words are to be construed\\nas understood by mankind in general, in\\ntheir ordinary meaning. The language\\nof the alleged libel is to be understood as\\nused in the ordinary and most natural\\nsense. [Footnotes omitted.]”\\n\\n§ 159 The Law of Libel and Slander in the\\nState of New York, Seelman, Vol. 1.\\n\\nThe same general rule has been the rule\\nof our cases. In McGraw v. Thomason,\\n265 Ala. 635, 93 So.2d 741 (1957), this\\nCourt held:\\n\\n“In determining their actionable char-\\nacter, the printed words are to be taken\\n\\nin their natural meaning, and according\\nto the sense in which they appear to\\nhave been used and the idea they are\\nadapted to convey to those who read\\nthem. A forced construction is not to be\\nput upon them in order to relieve the de-\\nfendant from liability, nor are they to be\\nsubjected to the critical analysis of a\\ntrained legal mind, but must be construed\\nand determined by the natural and prob-\\nable effect on the mind of the average\\nlay reader.\\n\\n* * * * * em\\n\\n“Fraud” is defined in the dictionary as\\n“an instance or act of trickery or deceit\\n* * %* the quality of being deceitful\\n* * * etc.” Webster\\'s Third New In-\\nternational Dictionary [G. & C. Merriam\\nCompany, Publishers.]\\n\\nTaking the ad as a whole, the headline,\\nthe news stories, and the imperative con-\\nclusion, and in light of the authorities, this\\nCourt, after mature consultation, considers\\nthat a genuine issue of a material fact was\\npresented as to whether the words of the\\n\\n_ ad impute criminal fraud, taking them “in\\n\\ntheir natural meaning, and according to the\\nsense in which they appear to have been\\nused and the idea they are adapted to con-\\nvey to those who read them.”\\nThomason, supra. To say more might\\njeopardize this cause on remand,\\n\\nMoving now to the Times question, we\\nhave stated that we consider the question\\nof “actual malice” presents a genuine issue\\nas to a material fact.\\n\\nHE The Times privilege is, of course,\\nconditional not absolute, and damages may\\nbe recovered upon proof of “actual malice.”\\nActual malice is defined in N.Y. Times v.\\nSullivan: “with knowledge that it was\\nfalse or with reckless disregard of whether\\nit was false or not.”\\n\\nIMI We have carefully reviewed and\\nre-reviewed the documents submitted on\\n\\nMcGraw v. .\\n\\nLS 149\\n\\nsummary judgment and must agree with\\nthe U.S. District Court in Goldwater v.\\nGinzburg, D.C., 261 F.Supp. 784 (1966),\\naff\\'d 2 Cir. 414 F.2d 324, cert. denied, 396\\nU.S. 1049, 90 S.Ct. 701, 24 L.Ed.2d 695\\nthat:\\n\\n“The issue of actual malice on the part\\n\\nof defendants seems peculiarly inappro-\\n\\npriate for disposition by summary judg-\\n\\nment because it concerns ‘motive, intent,\\n\\nand subjective feelings and reactions’.”\\n\\nAgain, as we heretofore expressed our-\\nselves with respect to the first issue—\\nfraud—we would run the risk of jeopardiz-\\ning this cause on remand to add anything\\nmore with respect to this issue.\\n\\nHI We will say that there may be cir-\\ncumstances when a summary judgment is\\nentirely appropriate in a libel action; for\\nexample, in a case of “absolute privilege.”\\nSee Sheridan v.

The district\\njudge, determining that there was no genu-\\nine issue as to any material fact and that\\nthe insurer was entitled to judgment as a\\nmatter of law, granted the insurer’s motion\\nfor summary judgment. The plaintiff ben-\\neficiary has appealed the district judge’s\\ndecision to the Court of Appeals for the\\nFifth Circuit.\\n\\nEncountering uncertainty in the Ala-\\nbama law, the Court of Appeals has posed\\ncertain certified questions to us under pro-\\nvisions of the Alabama Constitution, Arti-\\ncle 6, § 140(b) (3). The questions are:\\n\\n1. Does the insurer’s failure to issue\\nthe policy exactly as applied for within\\n30 days of the date of application pre-\\nclude coverage from attaching as of the\\ndate of application pursuant to Condition\\n3 of the binding receipt?\\n\\n2. Was there a waiver of Condition 3\\nof the binding receipt by the insurer’s is-\\nsuance of a policy after 30 days from\\nthe date of application without knowl-\\nedge that the insured had become unin-\\nsurable before the date the policy was\\nprepared and issued?\\n\\n3. Did the policy clause providing\\nthat “this policy will be effective as soon\\nas it has been delivered to the owner and\\nthe first premium has been paid during\\nthe lifetime and continued insurability of\\n\\n\\n152 [|\\n\\nthe proposed insured” preclude coverage\\nunder the policy from attaching as of\\nNovember 6, the date in which the insur-\\ner placed the policy in the mail to its\\nagent, in view of the fact that the dece-\\ndent was admitted to a Birmingham hos-\\npital on November 4 suffering from a\\ngunshot wound which ultimately resulted\\nin death on November 13 when the evi-\\ndence shows insurer had no knowledge\\nof the injury to the insured?\\n\\n4. Does the insurer’s statement that\\nthe policy was issued on the basis of\\nmedical information furnished with the\\napplication estop the insurer to deny cov-\\nerage from the date of the Binding Re-\\nceipt although the policy was not issued\\nwithin 30 days even though insurer was\\nunaware at the time it made the state-\\nment that the insured had become wnin-\\nswrable? 8\\n\\n5, Is there an ambiguity between the\\npolicy and the Binding Receipt concern-\\ning the effective date of the policy? If\\nso, which provision controls under the\\nfacts of this case? ®\\n\\nBarnes v. Atlantic & Pacific Life Insur-\\nance Co., 514 F.2d 704, 709 (Sth Cir.1975).\\n\\nThe facts of this case as set out by the\\nCourt of Appeals and as stipulated by\\ncounsel, are as follows:\\n\\nH. M. McClendon, the defendant-ap-\\npellee’s soliciting agent, first called upon\\nRobert O. Barnes and Margie C. Barnes,\\nhusband and wife, in August of 1970 so-\\nliciting their application for insurance\\nupon the life of Robert O. Barnes on be-\\nhalf of the defendant-appellee. Agent\\nMcClendon represented to the Barnes\\nthat a. monthly automatic premium\\ncheck-off at the Barnes’ bank in Colum-\\nbiana, Alabama would be made by the\\ndefendant-appellee. H. M. McClendon\\nagain called upon Robert O. Barnes, the\\ninsured, and Margie C. Barnes, the Ben-\\neficiary, husband and wife, on Septem-\\nber 8, 1970 at their home in Columbiana,\\nAlabama; and he secured an application\\n\\nfor life insurance and an initial premium\\npayment by cash of Twenty-two and\\n47/100 Dollars ($22.47) from Robert O.\\nBarnes giving him in return a Binding\\nReceipt. The application was for a poli-\\ncy of life insurance in the amount of\\n$10,000. The premium for a $10,000 pol-\\nicy applied for by Robert O, Barnes was\\n$21.57 per month, Said printed Binding\\nReceipt reflects in Agent McClendon’s\\nhandwriting the receipt of a Twenty-two\\nand 47/100 Dollar ($22.47) initial\\nmonthly premium and “amount . . .\\n$10,000.00. $20,000.00.” The\\nBinding Receipt stipulates the effective\\ndate of the policy will be the later of:\\n\\n“date of application, or date of medi-\\ncal examination, if required, provided\\nthat the\\n\\n1. proposed insured is determined by\\nthe Company at its Home Office in\\nAtlanta, Georgia, in accordance with\\nits rules and practices, to be insurable\\non such date for the policy exactly as\\napplied for;\\n\\n2, first full premium is paid in cash\\non date of application ;\\n\\n3. policy is issued exactly as applied\\nfor within 30 days from this date;\\n\\n4, total insurance in force with the\\n\\n» Company on the life of the proposed\\ninsured, including amount now applied\\nfor, will not exceed $50,000.00.”\\n\\nThe application was filled out by\\nAgent McClendon,. signed by Robert O.\\nBarnes and provided, inter alia medical\\ninformation to the company. There had\\nbeen discussion between Agent Mc-\\nClendon and Robert O. Barnes about ad-\\nditional coverage for accidental death.\\nNo notation was made on the application\\nconcerning any double indemnity cover-\\nage for accidental death, except there\\nwas a premium notation of payment in\\nadvance of $22.47 on the application—\\nthe total amount of premium including\\naccidental death benefits coverage on a\\n\\n\\nee 153\\nLe\\npolicy as applied for by Barnes. The Agent McClendon attempted physical\\n\\napplication was referred to in and made\\na part of the policy. Robert O. Barnes\\ndisclosed on the application that he had a\\nlung operation at Prattsburg Air Force\\nBase, New York, while in military serv-\\nice. “A week or two after McClendon\\ntook Barnes’ application” he returned to\\nBarnes’ residence and secured Barnes’\\nsignature to a medical authorization\\nform to be used by the defendant-appel-\\nlee’s underwriting department in deter-\\nmining if they were to issue the policy.\\nNo further contact was made between\\nMcClendon or defendant-appellee with\\nRobert O. Barnes or his beneficiary until\\nafter his death on November 13, 1970.\\n\\nThe binding receipt was never sent to\\ndefendant by its agent. The application\\nwas forwarded to defendant and was\\nprocessed for a policy of life insurance\\nin the amount of $10,000.\\n\\nOn November 4, 1970 the insured was\\nadmitted to the Veterans’ Administration\\nHospital in Birmingham, Alabama with\\ngunshot wounds to the face and died on\\nNovember 13, 1970 due to cerebral con-\\ncussion and hemorrhagic pneumonia.\\n\\nOn November 6, 1970 defendant pre-\\npared a policy of life insurance on the\\nlife of Robert O. Barnes in the amount\\nof $10,000 with an effective date of No-\\nvember 5, 1970 and with an initial premi-\\num of $21.57, This policy was mailed to\\ndefendant’s agent for delivery to Robert\\nO. Barnes along with a letter dated No-\\nvember 5, 1970, addressed to Robert O.\\nBarnes, referring to Policy Number\\n70K2580, reflecting a carbon copy to\\n“Agent: H. M. McClendon” and en-\\nclosed therewith “Receipt for First Pre-\\nmium and Record of First Payment.”\\nNeither defendant nor its agent had any\\nknowledge on November 6, 1970 or prior\\nthereto that Robert O. Barnes had suf-\\nfered gunshot wounds on November 4,\\n1970 and was in the hospital on Novem-\\nber 6, 1970.\\n\\ndelivery of the policy to the Barnes’\\nhome on November 14, 1970—the funeral\\ndate of Robert O. Barnes. Defendant’s\\nagent did not know when he attempted\\nto deliver the policy to Robert O. Barnes\\non November 14, 1970 that Robert O.\\nBarnes had been shot and had died the\\nday before. When he learned Mr.\\nBarnes was dead, the agent mailed the\\npolicy back to defendant’s Home Office.\\n\\n-On December 4, 1970 the defendant-\\nappellee mailed its check payable to the\\nplaintiff-appellant for Twenty-two and\\n47/100 Dollars ($22.47) stating “during\\nour investigation of the pending applica-\\ntion pertaining to his past medical histo-\\nry, we were unable to issue and deliver\\nthe insurance policy as he applied for\\nduring his good health, insurability and\\nlifetime.” This quoted verbiage is taken\\nfrom that paragraph of the policy which\\nis styled “Effective Date’ except the\\nwords “good health” are added by the\\nwriter thereof—C. Ervin Waller, Presi-\\ndent of defendant-appellee. The para-\\ngraph in the policy entitled “Effective\\nDate” is as follows:\\n\\n“Effective Date—This policy will be\\neffective as soon as it has been deliv-\\nered to the owner and the first premi-\\num has been paid during the lifetime\\nand continued insurability of the pro-\\nposed insured. If the first premium is\\npaid in exchange for a binding receipt\\non the date of application, then this\\npolicy will become effective as pro-\\nvided in the binding receipt.”\\n\\n514 F.2d at 707-09.\\n\\n_The Court of Appeals has determined\\nthat the sole question before it is “whether\\npursuant to a (1) binding receipt or (2)\\npolicy itself a policy of life insurance was\\nin effect covering appellant/beneficiary’s\\ndeceased husband at the time of his death.”\\n514 F.2d at 706,\\n\\nRather than responding to the questions\\nin the form certified, we have followed the\\n\\n\\n154\\n\\nsuggestion of the Court of Appeals to di-\\nrect our attention to what we consider to\\nbe the basic issues underlying those ques-\\ntions. See Martinez v, Rodriquez, 394 F.\\n2d 156 (Sth Cir. 1968), permitting “the\\n[state] Supreme Court’s restatement of the\\nissue or issues and the manner in which\\nthe answers are to be given, whether as a\\ncomprehensive whole or in subordinate or\\neven contingent parts.” Jd, at 159, n. 6.\\nSee also the suggestion of Chief Judge\\nBrown to like effect at footnote 10, p. 709,\\nBarnes v. Atlantic & Pacific Life Insur-\\nance Co., supra.\\n\\nHM Had there been no binding receipt\\nissued on the date of the application, it is\\nclear from our relevant case law that the\\nproposed coverage would never have be-\\ncome effective under the provisions of the\\npolicy itself. The policy provides that it\\n“will be effective as soon as it has been\\ndelivered to the owner and the first premi-\\num has been paid during the lifetime and\\ncontinued insurability of the proposed in-\\nsured.” Such provisions have been found\\nby this Court to be both “reasonable and\\nvalid.” Life & Casualty Insurance Co. v.\\nLatham, 255 Ala. 160, 164, 50 So.2d 727,\\n731 (1951). Failure to satisfy the condi-\\ntions set out in such policy provisions re-\\nsults in a failure of the ‘policy to become\\neffective.\\n\\nTHM Jn the instant case, coverage\\nfailed to become effective under the terms\\nof the policy because the policy was not\\ndelivered during the “continued insurabili-\\nty” of the insured. The latter suffered a\\nfatal gunshot wound on November 4, two\\ndays prior to the delivery of the policy on\\nNovember 6. [The policy was placed in\\nthe mail that day to the agent.) Under\\nAlabama case law, delivery to the insured\\nis accomplished on the date that the insur-\\ner mails the policy to its agent with the in-\\ntention that the agent turn it over to the\\ninsured. E.g., United Insurance Co. v.\\nHeadrick, 275 Ala. 594, 597, 157 So.2d 19,\\n22 (1963).\\n\\nHl We preface our analysis of the ef-\\nfect of the binding receipt by noting that\\nwe are in agreement with the following ad-\\nmonition expressed by the Supreme Court\\nof Kansas in its opinion in Service v. Pyr-\\namid Life Insurance Co., 201 Kan. 196,\\n211, 440 P.2d 944, 956-57 (1968) :\\n\\n“There is a great confusion of author-\\nity as to the effect to be given such re-\\nceipts. Because of the similarity of\\nwording usually found in them, attempts\\nhave been made to generalize their oper-\\nation, If these apparently conflicting\\nauthorities are examined, however, it be-\\ncomes clear that these receipts are not\\ncapable of general treatment, but must\\nbe individually interpreted to give them\\nthe effect which the parties intended\\nthem to have in’ each case. The funda-\\nmental question is: What was their\\nfunction ?”\\n\\nUnder the terms of the binding receipt\\nat issue in this case, coverage is contingent\\nupon the occurrence of several conditions.\\nThe insurer relies on two separate grounds\\nfor its assertion that not all of these condi-\\ntions were met.\\n\\n1. The insurer bases its first argument\\non the language of conditions one and\\nthree of the binding receipt requiring that\\nthe policy be “issued exactly as applied for.”\\nThe insurer argues that if the insured ap-\\nplied for double indemnity coverage for ac-\\ncidental death, as the beneficiary, his wife,\\nclaims, then the policy prepared by the in-\\nsurer was not “issued exactly as applied\\nfor” because it does not include double in-\\ndemnity coverage. It is further argued\\nthat the application for $10,000 coverage\\nwith double indemnity for accidental death\\namounted to an offer to buy insurance and\\nthat the policy prepared by the insurer,\\nwhich did not provide for double indemnity\\ncoverage, amounted to a counteroffer and,\\nin effect, was a rejection of the insured’s\\noffer.\\n\\n[Ml The principles on which the insurer\\nrelies are well-established in Alabama law\\n\\n\\nDe 155\\nDel\\n\\nand have been recently re-stated by this\\nCourt in Life Insurance Co. v. Miller, 292\\nAla. 525, 529, 296 So.2d 900, 903 (1974):\\n\\nan application for insurarice\\nis a mere offer which does not ripen into\\na contract until accepted by the insur-\\nance company. If the company issues a\\npolicy materially different from that ap-\\nplied for, in the eyes of the law, the pol-\\nicy is a rejection of the offer and is a\\ncounter-offer which becomes a binding\\ncontract only when accepted by the orig-\\ninal offeror—the would-be insured.”\\n\\nIn Miller, the insurer issued a policy in-\\ncorporating all of the terms of the appli-\\ncant’s offer except the offer premium rate;\\nthe policy issued by the insurer up-rated\\nthe premium. Construing the policy most\\nstrongly against its framer, the insurer,\\nthis Court found that the insurer’s decision\\nto up-rate the policy was clearly arbitrary\\nand that, therefore, the up-rate should be\\ndisregarded in construing the policy, thus\\nprecluding the argument that the policy was\\na counteroffer. For somewhat different\\nreasons, the facts in the instant case also\\nmay support the contention that the insurer\\nis estopped from asserting that the policy\\nin question was a counteroffer rather than\\nan‘acceptance of the insured’s offer.\\n\\nI The record in this case, includes ev-\\nidence which tends to show that the in-\\nsured intended to apply for double indem-\\nnity coverage for accidental death; that\\nthe insurer’s agent was aware of the in-\\nsured’s intent; that, through the agent’s\\noversight in filling out the application\\nform for the insured, the agent inadver-\\ntently omitted mention of the applied-for\\ndouble indemnity coverage; and that, at\\nthe time the policy was prepared, the in-\\nsurer was unaware of insured’s request for\\ndouble indemnity coverage. Under this\\nview of the facts, how can it be said that\\nthe insurer prepared its policy intending it\\nto be a counteroffer and hence a rejection\\nof the insured’s offer?\\n\\nHMM (Of even more persuasive force is\\nthe rule that\\n\\n«\\n\\nwoe ‘a party who deals with an\\nagent, through whom he applies for and\\nobtains a policy, has a right to presume\\nthat such material facts as are made\\nknown to him, are known to the principal\\n\\nAlabama Mutual Fire Insurance Co, v.\\nMinchener, 133 Ala. 632, 635, 32 So. 225,\\n226 (1901). Under that rule an insured\\nwould be justified in relying on the insur-\\ner’s agent to correctly inform the insurer\\nof the terms of the insured’s offer and that\\nthere ought not to be a denial of coverage\\nmerely because of the oversight of the in-\\nsurer’s agent.\\n\\nAdditionally, we would rely on a line of\\ncases which, although not directly on point\\nfactually, impress us with their compelling\\nlogic. In these cases, the issue was wheth-\\ner the insurer could avoid liability on the\\nground that the application for insurance\\nmisrepresented some fact bearing on the\\nrisk of loss the insurer was asked to as-\\nsume, when the misrepresentation was due\\nto the oversight of the insurer’s agent.\\nThese cases have been unanimous in their\\nconclusion that\\n\\n“[1] It is fully settled in this jurisdic-\\ntion that misrepresentations resulting\\nsolely from the act or oversight of the\\nsoliciting agent taking the application,\\nwithout the knowledge of the insured or\\nbeneficiary, are not available to the in-\\nsurer, although the issuing authority acts\\nupon the application as presented, and\\nwithout knowledge of the misfeasance of\\nits agent.”\\n\\nInter-Ocean Casualty Co, v. Ervin, 229\\nAla. 312, 313, 156 So, 844, 845 (1934).\\nFurthermore, it has been held that\\n\\n. .

St. Clair, 41 Ala.App. 243, 130 So.2d\\n213 (1961).\\n\\nHM 2. 4 second ground which the\\ninsurer asserts for the nonoccurrence of\\nthe conditions required by the binding re-\\nceipt is the failure of the insurer to issue\\nthe policy within 30 days from the date of\\nthe application [condition three of the\\nbinding receipt]. In reply thereto, the in-\\nsured argues that this provision was\\n“waived” by issuance of the policy. We\\ndo not consider this argument to be per-\\nsuasive. The insured interprets the 30-day\\nprovision to mean that the insurer would\\nbe under no legal obligation to issue its\\npolicy if it did not do so within a 30-day\\nperiod. This, we consider to be a misinter-\\npretation of the effect of the 30-day provi-\\nsion. The requirement that the policy be\\nissued within 30 days is nothing more than\\na condition which must be met in order for\\ncoverage to become effective from the date\\nof the application rather than the date of\\nissuance of the policy. For the require-\\nment of issuance within 30 days to be\\nwaived by the insurer, there must be a\\nclear manifestation of intent to do so.\\nThe mere issuance of a policy at a time\\nsubsequent to the 30-day period is not in it-\\nself a sufficient manifestation of an intent\\nto waive one of the conditions to coverage\\nunder the binding receipt.\\n\\nHE Although we find no substance\\nto the waiver argument, there would ap-\\npear to us to be some support in the record\\nfor the argument that the insurer may be\\nestopped from denying coverage on the ba-\\nsis of its failure to issue the policy within\\n30 days. This argument is founded upon\\ngeneral principles of contract law. Where\\na promisor’s duty to perform is conditioned\\n\\nupon the occurrence of some event wholly\\nwithin his control, there is an implied duty\\nof good faith and fair dealing owing from\\nthe promisor. If the promisor’s failure to\\ncooperate results in the nonoccurrence of\\nthe condition, the condition is thereby ex-\\ncused, “The justification for the rule\\nwhich makes prevention or hindrance by\\nthe promisor a breach of the duty of good\\nfaith and fair dealing as well as an excuse\\nof the condition may be found in the as-\\nsumption of the parties to the contract that\\nthe promisor would take reason-\\nable, positive action to ascertain its occur-\\nrence.” J, Murray, Murray on Contracts §\\n187, at 365 (1974). Where a binding re-\\nceipt is conditioned upon issuance of a pol-\\nicy within a certain time, the proposed in-\\nsured is justified in assuming that the in-\\nsurer will exercise reasonable care and dili-\\ngence in acting upon his application. De\\nFord v. New York Life Insurance Co., 75\\nColo, 146, 224 P. 1049 (1924).\\n\\nAlthough not factually on all-fours, the\\nrecent Oklahoma case of Peddicord v. Pru-\\ndential Inswrance Co., 498 P.2d 1388 (Okl.\\n1972) contains language to like effect.\\nThere, it was held:\\n\\n“Ck & % We think it may well be\\n\\nheld that there was an implied contract\\nif not a legal contract * * * on the\\npart of the insurance company to act on\\nthe application within a reasonable time;\\nthat is, either to accept the application\\nand issue the policy, or reject the same,\\nso that the applicant could secure insur-\\nance elsewhere, . . ..’”\\n\\n498 P.2d at 1390.\\n\\nHMM Whether the insurer’s delay in\\nissuing the policy in this case was within\\nthe bounds of reasonableness is certainly\\nnot a question which we can resolve. The\\ntecord contains some evidence which would\\nseem to indicate that the delay in issuance\\nwas unreasonable. Thus, if the policy was\\nissued solely on the basis of the informa-\\ntion contained in the application obtained\\non September 8, a delay of issuance until\\n\\n\\nNovember 6 would seem to be unreasona-\\nble. This view of the evidence is support-\\ned by a letter prepared by the insurer and\\nenclosed with the policy, This letter states\\nthat the policy was “issued on the basis of\\nthe application you [the insured] recently\\ngave our representative.” The letter fur-\\nther states that the policy is of a type “is-\\nsued only to persons who furnish evidence\\nof insurability, which was supplied with\\nyour application.”\\n\\nOn the other hand, the insurer contends\\nthat the delay in issuance was caused by de-\\nlays it encountered in obtaining records of\\nthe insured’s medical history during his\\nmilitary service.\\n\\nAgain, we would observe that a resolu-\\ntion of these conflicting contentions is not\\nfor our determination,\\n\\nHMM Turning now to insured’s argu-\\nment that there is ambiguity between the\\nprovisions of the policy and the binding re-\\nceipt concerning the effective date of the\\npolicy, our case law has long adhered to\\n“the rule of liberal construction in favor of\\nthe insured of insurance policies in case of\\nany ambiguity.” New York Life Insur-\\nance Co. v. Torrance, 224 Ala. 614, 617,\\n141 So. 547, 550 (1932).\\n\\nHowever, we see no ambiguity un-\\nder the language at hand here. The policy\\nprovides that, if a binding receipt has been\\nissued, the effective date of the policy is to\\nbe determined under the provisions of the\\nbinding receipt. The binding receipt pro-\\nvides that its date is to be the effective\\ndate of the policy only if certain conditions\\nare satisfied. This Court interprets this\\nlanguage to provide that the terms of the\\n\\nbinding receipt are to control only if its\\n\\nconditions are met and that otherwise the\\nterms of the policy are controlling.\\n\\nUnder Alabama law, therefore,\\nthe effective date of the policy is to be de-\\ntermined by the binding receipt, if the, con-\\nditions contained therein are met. Based\\nupon the record before us, we believe there\\n\\nis a question of fact to be resolved on the\\nissue of waiver or estoppel on the part of\\nthe insurer insofar as condition 3 of the\\nbinding receipt is concerned.\\n\\nThe foregoing states Alabama law on\\nthe issues underlying the questions certi-\\nfied.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

As modi-\\nfied by order of this Court in conformity\\nwith this opinion, the final decree of the\\ntrial Court is affirmed.\\n\\nThe facts are virtually without dispute.\\nIn late 1962, Lincoln Industrial Insurance\\nCompany (appellee) owned and offered for\\nsale to Christine Juanita Gray (appellant)\\n\\na house and lot in the Ensley community -\\n\\nof Jefferson County. Lincoln’s original\\noffer was $12,500 sales price, $1,000 down-\\n\\npayment, and a balance in unspecified _\\n\\nmonthly payments at an annual interest\\nrate of 8%.\\n\\nAlthough a title insurance binder in the\\namount of $12,500 was ordered, Gray\\nsought the services of an attorney to pur-\\nsue the negotiations further and to repre-\\nsent her in closing the transaction. When it\\nwas pointed out to Lincoln by the attorney\\nthat his client could pay only $45 to $50\\nper month and that this would be inade-\\nquate to retire even the interest at 8%,\\nLincoln agreed to reduce the purchase\\nprice to $11,500 (with $1,000 down), the\\n\\n1. All of these legal documents were the tradi-\\ntional printed forms with blanks to be filled\\nin to fit the particular facts of the situation.\\n‘The note was what is sometimes referred to as\\na bank “long form” note.\\n\\ninterest rate to 5%, and to accept $50 pe:\\nmonth on the balance.\\n\\nAfter clearing several deficiencies shown\\nin the title binder, Lincoln’s attorney pre-\\npared and forwarded the deed, the mort-\\ngage, and the note! to Gray’s attorney\\nwho supervised the closing of the transac-\\ntion, including the preparation of a closing\\nstatement, delivery and recordation of the\\ndocuments.\\n\\nThe deed showed a consideration of\\n$11,500. The mortgage stated the amount\\nof indebtedness as $10,500, payable on the\\n2nd day of May, 1963, and the 2nd day of\\neach month thereafter at $50 per month\\nwith “interest of 5% included”. The clos-\\ning statement reflected the $1,000 down\\npayment and a title policy—consistent with\\nthe binder—was issued for $12,500, Pay-\\nments of $50 per month were regularly and\\ntimely made by the purchaser until Janu-\\nary, 1970.\\n\\nOn January 9, 1970, Gray’s attorney in-\\nformed Lincoln by letter, “On the 2nd day\\nof April, 1963, you sold Lot 12 in Block A,\\nUnit Land Company’s first addition to En-\\nsley to Christine Juanita Gray for the sum\\nof $11,500, which sum of money included\\ninterest over the period of payment.” The\\nletter then set out the pertinent parts of\\nthe note in which the only reference to in-\\nterest was, “Interest shall be payable on\\nthe respective installments at the legal rate\\nper annum after maturity thereof.”\\n\\nAfter commenting that the note was se-\\ncured by a mortgage, the letter concluded:\\n“According to my figures, I am enclosing,\\nherewith, a check for $50 to pay for Janu-\\nary, 1970. This will be 115 payments.\\nThis amounts to $5,850 paid which leaves a\\nbalance of $4,650.” The controversy\\nbrought to light by this letter ultimately\\nculminated in this litigation.?\\n\\n2. For the purpose of clarity, it should be noted\\nthat monthly payments continued through\\nSeptember, 1973; that no issue of waiver or\\nestoppel is raised with respect to Lincoln’s\\nreceipt thereof; and that default is not\\n\\n\\n160\\n\\nThe posture of the record before us is\\nsomewhat confusing because plaintiff\\'s bill\\nfor declaratory judgment sought relief on\\none theory (reformation); the defendant\\nchose to defend on a different theory (con-\\nsistency of the note and mortgage provid-\\ning interest only after maturity); and the\\ntrial Court’s decree granting plaintiff relief\\nis founded on a third theory (patent ambi-\\nguity admitting of parol evidence to dis-\\ncern true intent of the parties), Thus, a\\nbrief review of the respective contentions\\nof the parties and the basis for the trial\\nCourt’s final decree is necessary to place\\nin perspective the issue presented for our\\nreview.\\n\\nLincoln, through its attorney, both by its\\npleadings and proof, says the parties\\nthrough their negotiations arrived at a mu-\\ntual assent for the sale and purchase of the\\nreal property in question, The mortgage,\\nthough not a model of perspicuity, accu-\\nrately and adequately express the meeting\\nof the minds. The sales price of $11,500\\nwas reduced by a $1,000 down payment to\\n$10,500, which balance was to be paid at\\nthe annual interest rate of 5% with both\\nthe principal and interest included in the\\n$50 per month payments. The note,\\nthrough mutual mistake or scrivener’s er-\\nror, omitted any reference to interest ex-\\ncept the reference contained in the printed\\nform which refers to interest at the legal\\nrate from the date of maturity. The plain-\\ntiff’s pleading (bill for declaratory judg-\\nment), both as to averments of fact and\\nprayer for relief, and its uncontradicted\\nevidence support reformation of the note to\\nexpress the contract mutually agreed upon\\nby the parties.\\n\\nGray, through her attorney, offered a\\ndefense totally foreign to the reformation\\ntheory. Consistent with the position taken\\nin her attorney’s letter to Lincoln dated\\nJanuary 9, 1970, she contended that the\\n\\nclaimed for nonpayment from September,\\n1973, to the date of the filing of suit in March,\\n1974, there being an agreement between the\\n\\nwords employed by the mortgage, “with in-\\nterest of 5% included,” rendered the note’s\\nomission of any reference to interest (ex-\\ncept from maturity) correct, because the\\nmortgage indebtedness of $10,500 included\\nthe 5% interest.\\n\\nAppellant’s argument is fallacious, both\\nlegally and factually: factually, because\\n$10,500, by all the evidence—oral and doc-\\numentary—represented the principal bal-\\nance of the debt; and legally, because the\\nword “included”, as here used, can only re-\\nfer to the $50 per month payments rather\\nthan to the $10,500 amount of the debt.\\nNo evidence was adduced by the purchaser\\nto refute either of these conclusions.\\n\\nThat the trial Judge viewed the disposi-\\ntive issue as controlled by yet a third legal\\ntheory can be seen at the very outset of\\nthe trial, when he observed:\\n\\n“IT have looked at the note straight\\nfrom the mortgage, and the language\\nmay be said to be ambiguous, and if it is\\nambiguous, it devolves upon the Court to\\ntry to determine what the intentions\\nwere, and the only way we can do that is\\nto take testimony.”\\n\\nThe ambiguity theory, pursued by the\\nCourt throughout the trial, culminated in\\nits decree:\\n\\n«, There is a patent ambiguity\\nin a portion of the writing in a mortgage ©\\nand mortgage note . . . The ambi-\\nguity concerns the amount of interest as\\nprovided in the mortgage and in the\\nmortgage note. Under the laws of the\\nState of Alabama the mortgage is given\\nto secure the note. The language em-\\nployed in the note where it is ambiguous\\nhas primacy over that language em-\\nployed for the same purpose in the mort-\\ngage. Under the statute, relative to in-\\nterest which may be charged where the\\n\\nparties with respect to the payments due\\nfrom October, 1973, to the date of the resolu-\\ntion of this litigation.\\n\\n\\n‘legal rate’ is employed (as in the note),\\nthe plaintiff would be entitled to interest\\nat 6%. However, plaintiff does not in-\\nsist upon any rate of interest in excess\\n\\nof 5%.\\n\\n“Under the language in both instru-\\nments when considered in pari materia,\\ninterest is due to be charged and credited\\nto each monthly payment, is included in\\nsaid payment and may be deducted, and\\nthe balance after deduction of interest\\ncredited to the principal balance due.”\\n\\nWe are appreciative of the enigma faced\\nby the appellant by this anomalous turn of\\nevents. Indeed, the grounds included in\\nher motion for a new trial give expression\\nto her dilemma, If this is a patent ambi-\\nguity case, then was not all the extrinsic\\nevidence considered by the Court erro-\\nneously admitted? Garrow v. Toxey, 188\\nAla. 572, 66 So. 443 (1914). If the ambi-\\nguity is to be devolved from the four cor-\\nners of the documents, with the language.\\nof the note given primacy over the mort-\\ngage, how then could “interest 2. .\\nat the legal rate per annum after maturity\\nthereof” result in any addition of interest\\nprior to the maturity date of each pay-\\nment?\\n\\nOur ability to appreciate -the problem,\\nhowever, does not result in our reversal of\\nthe decree below. This is not an “ambigu-\\nity” case. The pleadings and the uncontra-\\ndicted evidence support plaintiffs reforma-\\ntion theory.\\n\\nHN The power of Alabama courts to\\nreform written instruments extends to\\npromissory notes.

In\\nBrown, this Court stated that when a note\\nand a mortgage contain conflicting and ir-\\nreconcilable provisions as to the character\\nor terms of the debt, or the time for its\\npayment, the note will govern as being the\\nobligation. The Brown case, however, did\\nnot involve a complaint for reformation;\\nrather, it involved an attempt to determine\\nwhether the statute of limitations of cer-\\ntain promissory notes began to run from\\nthe date of execution or the date of matu-\\nrity. The Brown Court faced a construc-\\ntion problem in which the intent of the\\nparties was not clear.\\n\\nThe case at hand presents a different\\nproblem. Here, the actual agreement be-\\ntween the parties is established by over-\\nwhelming evidence, but the promissory\\nnote, through a draftsman’s error, does not\\nexpress that agreement. The rule set out in\\nBrown did not arise to govern the drafts-\\nman’s error/reformation problem; there-\\nfore, it is not applicable to this case.\\n\\nWe hold that Lincoln is entitled to the\\nrelief prayed for.

We affirm.\\n\\nCain filed a complaint for declaratory\\njudgment seeking to establish a boundary\\nbetween his and Cameron’s property as the\\nold Arkadelphia Road. Cameron filed a\\ncounterclaim seeking injunctive relief\\nagainst a poultry operation which Cain ran\\non his property. The trial Judge heard the\\nevidence without a jury and made a person-\\nal inspection of the premises before he ren-\\ndered ‘a judgment which established a\\nboundary line as the old Arkadelphia Road\\nand dismissed the counterclaim as moot be-\\ncause Cain had discontinued his poultry op-\\neration 18 months before the law suit.\\n\\nActing as her own attorney, Cameron\\nappealed the trial Judge’s decision to this\\nCourt. She requests us to retry the facts\\nof the case and render a judgment in her\\nfavor. It is not, however, the function of\\nthis Court to retry law suits. Both Cain\\nand Cameron had equal opportunity to\\npresent their cases to the trial Judge. Our\\nreview of the record reveals that both\\nsides supported their claims with evidence\\nwhich was sufficient to uphold judgments\\nin their favor. Cain presented evidence\\nthat he and his predecessor had occupied\\nthe property up to the road since at least\\n1914 without any dispute that the road was\\nthe boundary line. Cameron presented evi-\\ndence of a recent survey done .at her re-\\nquest which showed that she owned a strip\\nof land on Cameron’s side of the road.\\n\\nHM This Court will not retry issues\\nof fact.

Clewis’s request\\nfor back pay for the period December,\\n1973, to June 11, 1974, was denied by the\\ncity.\\n\\nThe trial Court held:\\n\\n“{He] is not entitled to receive back\\npay for the period of time that the said\\nW. C. Clewis was placed on leave of ab-\\nsence pursuant to the provisions of Rule\\n3.8 of the Personnel Board for Mobile\\nCounty, Alabama ;”\\n\\nFrom this adverse judgment, the Personnel\\nBoard appeals.\\n\\nThe Personnel Board of Mobile County\\nexists under the provisions of Local Act\\nNo. 470, approved September 15, 1939, Lo-\\n\\n“cal Acts of Alabama, 1939, p. 298, as\\namended. Section IX of that Act provides.\\nthat the Director of the Personnel Board\\n“shall recommend such Rules as he may\\nconsider necessary, appropriate, or desira-\\nble to carry out the provisions of this Act,\\nand may from time to time recommend\\namendments thereto.” It further provides\\nthat “[t]he powers herein conferred upon\\nthe Director shall be subject only to the\\nprovisions of this Act and of the Rules\\nadopted hereunder . . .”. Pursuant to\\nthis authority, the Board promulgated Rule\\n3.8.\\n\\n“ABSENCE WITH LEAVE. 3.8.\\nAn employee who is temporarily incapac-\\nitated from performing his duties, or de-\\nsires to engage in a course of study such\\nas will increase his usefulness upon his\\nreturn to duty, or who for any reason\\nconsidered good by the Appointing Au-\\nthority desires to secure a leave of ab-\\n\\nsence from regular duty may, upon the\\nrecommendation of the Appointing Au-\\nthority and with the approval of the\\nDirector, be granted leave without pay\\nfor a period not to exceed one year;\\nprovided, however, that approval of the\\nDirector shall not be required for a\\nleave or leaves aggregating not more\\nthan fourteen (14) calendar days within\\nany twelve (12) months period. No\\nsuch leave shall be granted for the pur-\\npose of enabling an employee to engage\\nin other employment outside the Classi-\\nfied Service; provided, however, that an\\nemployee, may be granted special leave\\nfor a period not exceeding ninety days\\nfor the purpose of self employment in\\nagricultural pursuits; and, provided fur-\\nther that, if any governmental agency\\nshould request the temporary services of\\na technically trained employee for the\\npurpose of assisting in adopting or in-\\nstalling a change in service, the Appoint-\\ning Authority may, with the approval of\\nthe Director, authorize a leave of ab-\\nsence. An employee requesting special ©\\nleave without pay shall submit his re-\\nquest in writing, stating the reasons why\\nsuch a request should be granted, the\\ndate when he desires leave to begin, and\\nthe date of return to duty. An employee\\nwho fails to report for duty upon the ex-\\npiration of any such leave of absence\\nwill be considered to have resigned.\\n\\n“An employee who, at the direction of\\nhis Appointing Authority, attends a con-\\nference or institution for training or in-\\nstruction, shall be considered to be on\\nduty.\\n\\n“When an employee has been charged\\nwith a violation of the penal code, the\\nAppointing Authority may place him on\\nLeave of Absence, subject to the approv-\\nal of the Director, until the matter has\\nbeen adjudicated in the Courts, but not\\nto exceed sixty (60) days. If a further\\nextension is necessary, it must be ap-\\nproved by the Personnel Board.”\\n\\n\\n168\\n\\n(The last paragraph of the foregoing\\nRule was promulgated by the Personnel\\nBoard on September 9, 1971.)\\n\\nThe City contends that because the origi-\\nnal Rule 3.8 (entitled “Absence With\\nLeave”) prescribed that under certain con-\\nditions (incapacity, etc.) leaves of absence\\nwere authorized without pay, a leave based\\non another condition (criminal charges),\\nwhich was added by amendment, was also\\nwithout pay. In other words, by adopting\\na rule which included conditions authoriz-\\ning leave of absence and expressly provid-\\ning that under such enumerated conditions\\nthe granted leave would be without pay,\\nthe Board’s amendment of that rule adding\\nanother ground implicitly adopted the\\n“without pay” provisions of the original\\nrule.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Board argues\\nthat Rule 3.8 is not a “without pay” rule,\\nbut a “leave of absence” rule, Since the\\nadded condition for the grant of leave con-\\ntained in the amendment makes no mention\\nof pay for the period of leave granted, and\\nsince the conditions of the original rule are\\nvoluntary while the condition of the\\namendment is involuntary, leave with pay\\nis the apparent intent of the amendment.\\n\\nWhile these arguments present an inter-\\nesting challenge of legislative interpreta-\\ntion as they relate to Rule 3.8, as amended,\\nour resolution of the ultimate issue must\\nbegin with an analysis of the statute creat-\\ning the Board.\\n\\nHl In Section XXIII, the Act creating\\nthe Board prescribes the procedure for sus-\\npension without pay. The provisions of\\nthat section require a hearing in any sus-\\npension for a period of more than thirty\\ndays within one year, The Board cannot\\n\\ncircumvent that requirement with euphe-\\nmisms. An involuntary “leave of absence”\\nwithout pay is tantamount to a suspension\\nand the due process requirement of a hear-\\ning as provided in Section XXIII is neces-\\nsary.\\n\\nHHI The distinction between the first\\nportion of Rule 3.8—establishing leave of\\nabsence without pay—and the amendment\\nto the Rule—providing for leave of ab-\\nsence for anyone charged with violation of\\nthe Penal Code—is that the former leave\\nresults from the voluntary request of the\\nemployee to be put on leave, while the lat-\\nter results from the act of the Appointing\\nAuthority without the consent of the em-\\nployee. The Board is specifically autho-\\nrized under its rule-making power to make\\nreasonable provisions for “leave of ab-\\nsence” as it has done in the first portion of\\nRule 3.8, But when it amended the Rule\\nto include involuntary leave of absence for\\nemployees charged under the Penal Code,\\nthe Board had to comply with the suspen-\\nsion section (§ 23) of the Act. Since the\\nleave of absence under the penal charges\\namendment can extend for more than thirty\\ndays in one year, the employee cannot be\\ndeprived of his pay without a right to a\\nhearing. This amendment provided no\\nright to a hearing nor was a hearing held.\\nTherefore, the amendment is ineffective to\\npreclude Clewis’s right to back pay.\\n\\nReversed and remanded.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

We affirm as to the\\ndismissal of the claim for injunctive relief\\nand reverse and render a judgment as to\\nthe dismissal of the claim for declaratory\\nrelief.\\n\\nWe first address the dismissal of the\\nclaim for injunctive relief. Count One of\\nthe plaintiffs’ complaint sought to enjoin\\nthe developers from constructing a private\\naccess road which would connect its prop-\\nerty to Symer Road, a public street which\\nabuts both the plaintiffs’ residential prop-\\nerty and the developers’ commercial prop-\\nerty. The plaintiffs based their demand\\nfor the injunction upon the allegation that\\nthe construction of the private access road\\nwould increase automobile traffic on\\nSmyer Road thereby constituting a nui-\\nsance (Tit. 7, § 1081, Code).\\n\\nAfter presenting affidavits, the defend-\\nants filed motions for dismissal and for\\nsummary judgment. The trial Court con-\\nsidered the motions and entered a decree\\ndismissing the cause “but without prejudice\\nto plaintiffs to bring an appropriate action\\nif and when the alleged anticipatory nui-\\nsance becomes real.”\\n\\nThe motions and affidavits authorized\\nthe trial Judge to either dismiss the com-\\nplaint or grant a summary judgment, but\\nhe granted only the motion for dismissal.\\nTherefore, we will limit our review to the\\npropriety of dismissing the plaintiffs’ com-\\nplaint.\\n\\nThere is statutory authority for enjoin-\\ning anticipatory private nuisances in Ala-\\nbama. Tit. 7, § 1083, Code, provides:\\n\\n“Where the consequences of a nui-\\nsance about to be erected or commenced\\nwill be irreparable in damages, and such\\nconsequences are not merely possible, but\\nto a reasonable degree certain, a court of\\nequity may interfere to arrest a nuisance\\nbefore it is completed.”\\n\\n\\n172\\n\\nIn Jackson v. Downey, 252 Ala. 649, 42\\nSo.2d 246 (1949), this Court construed Tit.\\n7, § 1083, Code, in the procedural context\\nof an order sustaining a defendent’s de-\\nmurrer and held that “if the facts averred\\npresent such a situation that if proven eq-\\nuity will intervene to grant relief, the case\\nshould proceed to a hearing on the evi-\\ndence . . .”, This statement is con-\\nsistent with the standard adopted by this\\nCourt for testing the sufficiency of a com-\\nplaint upon a 12(b)(6) motion. In Trabits\\nv. First National Bank of Mobile, 295 Ala.\\n—, 323 So.2d 353, (1975), this Court quot-\\ned with approval Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.\\nS. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), for\\nthe statement that:\\n\\n“In appraising the sufficiency of the\\ncomplaint we follow, of course, the ac-\\ncepted rule that a complaint should not\\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim\\nunless it appears beyond doubt that the\\nplaintiff can prove no set of facts in\\nsupport of his claim which would entitle\\nhim to relief.”\\n\\nUnder this standard, and order dismiss-\\ning a complaint under 12(b)(6) should\\nrarely be granted. But, in this case, the\\nplaintiffs’ complaint alleged all of the facts\\nwhich they could have proved in a hearing.\\nThose facts are that the completion of the\\nprivate road will increase automobile traf-\\nfic on Smyer Road. The question of\\nwhether an activity which increases auto-\\nmobile traffic on public roads is enjoinable\\nas a nuisance was addressed by this Court\\nin Drennen v. Mason, 222 Ala. 652, 133 So.\\n689 (1931). In that case this Court stated\\nthat, “The noises of increased automobile\\ntraffic, the stopping, starting and shifting\\ngears, incident to the rightful use of a pub-\\nlic street, cannot be regarded in this day as\\nsubstantial cause for injunctive relief\\nwhich deprives the citizen of the use of his\\nproperty.”\\n\\nWe reaffirm this as a correct\\nstatement of law. Although increased\\ntraffic may be one element of a nuisance\\n\\naction based upon an activity such as a\\ntruck terminal or a garage, increased traf-\\nfic alone cannot be regarded as a substan-\\ntial invasion of a property owner’s right to\\nthe enjoyment of his property. Thus, it\\nappears beyond doubt that the plaintiffs\\ncould prove no set of facts in support of\\ntheir claim which would entitle them to re-\\nlief and their claim for anticipatory in-\\njunctive relief was due to be dismissed.\\nThe decree of dismissal as to Count One is\\naffirmed.\\n\\nHE We now turn to the plaintiffs’\\nclaim for declaratory relief.. Count Two\\nof the complaint sought a declaration that\\nthe plaintiffs are not parties to the restric-\\ntive covenant between the City of Moun-\\ntain Brook and the developers and that the\\nplaintiffs are entitled to rely upon the con-\\nditions of the covenant as residents of the\\nCity of Mountain Brook in the event they\\nare. denied injunctive relief. There are\\ntwo covenants which concern the construc-\\ntion of the private access road. One is be-\\ntween the City of Homewood and the de--\\nvelopers; the other is between the City of\\nMountain Brook and the developers. Al-\\nthough the plaintiffs’ complaint sought de-\\nclaratory relief as to the Mountain Brook\\ncovenant, the plaintiffs attached only the\\nHomewood covenant to the complaint.\\nSince the covenants are substantially iden-\\ntical and since our reversal of this case\\ncould be based upon either covenant, we\\nwill not attempt to determine which cove-\\nnant the plaintiffs actually intended to in-\\nclude in their complaint. Both covenants\\nlimited the use of the private access road\\nto 150 cars which would be issued special\\npasses. Both covenants also included a\\nparagraph numbered 5(c), which provides\\nthat the entire covenat “shall, at the option\\nof the undersigned developers . . . be\\nnull and void and of no effect in the event\\n+ +. a suit or action shall be institut-\\ned by any person . . . against the un-\\ndersigned developers to enjoin . . .\\nthe use and enjoyment by the undersigned\\n\\n\\ndevelopers . . of any private road-\\nway . . . connecting up with the said\\nSmyer Road.” Since the plaintiffs in this\\nsuit have brought an action against the de-\\nvelopers as described in 5(c), they seek a\\ndeclaration that the 150 car limitation re-\\nmains in force despite provisions of para-\\ngraph 5(c).\\n\\nThe effect of paragraph 5(c) is to inhib-\\nit the plaintiffs’ right to seek relief in the\\ncourts. The developers and the two mu-\\nnicipalities have, by .contract, threatened\\nthat if the plaintiffs seek a legal adjudica-\\ntion of their rights, the contractual -bene-\\nfits the municipalities obtained for the\\nplaintiffs will be annulled. The covenant\\nplaces the plaintiffs in this dilemma: If\\nthey seek to enjoin the developers from\\nconstructing the private road, they will, by\\nvirtue of paragraph 5(c) invalidate the\\nagreement restricting the use of the pri-\\nvate road if it is constructed.\\n\\nBoth the Alabama courts and the Ala-\\nbama legislature have consistently reaf-\\nfirmed the public policy against contracts\\nwhich either interfere with the parties’\\nright to use the courts, or deprive the\\ncourts of their inherent jurisdiction. In\\nevidence of this policy, the legislature has\\nenacted statutes voiding confessions of\\njudgment (Tit. 20, § 16, Code) and prohib-\\niting contractual modification of statutes\\nof limitation (Tit. 7, § 28, Code).\\ncourts have manifested this policy by in-\\nvalidating the contractual agreements for\\nthe issuance of injunctions (Stokes v.\\nMoore, 262 Ala. 59, 77 So.2d 331 (1955) );\\nand by declaring that parties have no pow-\\ner to contract against finality of judgments\\nof the courts on issues within the courts’\\njurisdiction (John Hancock Mutual Life\\nInsurance Co. v. Large, 230 Ala. 621, 162\\nSo, 277 (1935); and by declaring that a\\ncontract to arbitrate and thus determine\\nwhether a party has a cause of action is\\nnot ordinarily enforceable (T. C. J. & R.\\nCo, v. Sizemore, 258 Ala. 344, 62 So.2d 459\\n(1952) ). It is important to note that all\\n\\nThe -\\n\\n178\\n\\nof these illustrations of the public policy in\\nthis area involve situations where the con-\\ntracting parties have impaired only their\\nown rights to use the courts. The instant\\ncase, however, involves a situation where\\nthe contracting parties have not only af-\\nfected their own rights, but have also af-\\nfected the rights of persons who are not\\nparties to the contract. Contractual provi-\\nsions which affect third party rights are\\neven more undesirable than those which af-\\nfect only the contracting parties because\\nthe third parties’ rights are impaired with-\\nout their consent,\\n\\nMoreover, when, as in this case, one of\\nthe contracting parties is a municipal cor-\\nporation which has agreed to a contractual\\nprovision impairing the rights of its resi-\\ndents to use the courts, we find an even\\nstronger public policy against the restric-\\ntive provision here in question. Municipal\\ncorporations, unlike private contracting\\nparties, derive their contracting power\\nfrom the legislature. Their power to con-\\ntract is, therefore, even more circum-\\nscribed than that of private parties, and\\nthe countervailing considerations of free-\\ndom of contract raised by private parties\\nagainst the public policy declarations of\\nthe legislature and the common law cannot\\navail municipal corporations.\\n\\nWe, therefore, hold that paragraph 5(c)\\nin both the Homewood and the Mountain\\nBrook covenants is invalid as contrary to\\npublic policy.\\n\\nThe fact that we declare paragraph 5(c)\\n\\n‘invalid, however, does not mean that the\\n\\nentire covenant is invalid. Without para-\\ngraph 5(c), the covenant is still supported\\nby adequate consideration, In return for\\nthe 150 car restriction, Homewood ap-\\nproved the developers’ request to vacate\\nExecutive Circle, resurvey the property,\\nand construct the private road, and Moun-\\ntain Brook declared that it would raise no\\nobjections to the developers’ plans. We,\\ntherefore, render a judgment that the cove-\\n\\n\\n174 |\\n\\nnant remain in force except for paragraph\\n5(c) which is deleted in full.\\n\\nAffirmed in part, reversed and rendered\\nin part.\\n\\nMERRILL, BLOODWORTH, FAULK-\\nNER, SHORES and EMBRY, JJ., concur.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

I can only\\nagree that the trial court’s granting of the\\nmotion to dismiss as to count two was im-\\nproper, because I believe the complaint, es-\\npecially when construed under Alabama’s\\nnew Rules of Procedure, states a “justicia-\\nble controversy.” In my opinion, the\\nplaintiffs barely state a claim for declara-\\ntory relief. The plaintiffs seek to have ad-\\njudicated “anticipatory rights” and this\\nCourt has said that a declaratory judgment\\nproceeding is not available to adjudicate\\nsuch anticipatory rights, and it is not suffi-\\ncient that parties anticipate that a justicia-\\nble controversy may arise.

Drake.\\n\\nSC 1426.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nJan. 2, 1976,\\n\\n\\nMarkstein & Morris, Birmingham, for\\nappellants.\\n\\nJames F. Berry, Cullman, for appellees.\\n\\nJONES, Justice.\\n\\nThis is an appeal from a decree enjoin-\\ning John Dix from foreclosing a mortgage\\nwhich he holds on the property of Vernett\\nand H. H. Drake. We affirm.\\n\\nThe mortgage in question is dated May\\n25, 1970, and was originally granted to\\nDix’s brother, Richard Morvay. Prior to\\nthe execution of the mortgage, H. H.\\nDrake owed Dix $4,050, which was repre-\\nsented by two unsecured promissory notes\\nand Dix owed Morvay an unsecured debt\\nof $5,000. For many years, Drake had\\nregularly borrowed money from Dix with-\\nout security and had repaid him. Shortly\\nbefore the execution of the mortgage in\\nquestion, Drake again approached Dix for\\nmoney. Each party tells a different ver-\\nsion of Dix’s response to Drake’s request.\\n\\nDrake’s version is that’ Dix told him he\\ndid not have enough money to lend him\\nanything, but his brother, Morvay, who\\nlived in California, might be able to lend\\n\\n\\n176\\n\\nDrake some money if Drake could give\\nMorvay some security. Drake said that he\\nagreed to this and persuaded his wife, who\\nowned a 60-acre farm, to execute a mort-\\ngage to Morvay as security for a $5,000\\nloan which Dix promised to get for Drake\\nfrom Morvay. Drake also says that on the\\ndate of the execution of the mortgage Dix\\nmade Drake an unsecured personal loan of\\napproximately $250. All of the parties\\nagree that Morvay never actually loaned\\nDrake any money.\\n\\nDix’s version is that when Drake ap-\\nproached him for more money, Dix agreed\\nto lend it to him if Drake could offer secu-\\nrity. When Drake persuaded his wife to\\nexecute a mortgage, Dix says that he told\\nDrake about his own $5,000 debt to Mor-\\nvay and asked Drake to execute a mort~-\\ngage to Morvay in exchange for a $950\\nloan from Dix. Drake agreed and Dix\\nloaned him $950 for the mortgage on Ver-\\nnett’s property. Dix concludes that the\\nnew $950 loan combines with Drake’s prior\\ndebt of $4,050 for the $5,000 figure on the\\nmortgage.\\n\\nThe mortgage provided for repayment of\\nthe $5,000 by May 25, 1971, and provided\\nfor no interest. Drake did not pay the\\ndebt within the year and Dix began fore-\\nclosure proceedings in May, 1972, In\\nJune, 1972, the Drakes and Dix entered an\\n\\nagreement whereby Dix agreed to stop the «\\n\\nforeclosure proceedings in exchange for\\n$1,050 cash and Drake’s promise to pay\\nDix $100 a week until his debt was paid\\noff. Drake never made any of the $100\\npayments and in June of 1973 Drake insti-\\ntuted this suit to enjoin the foreclosure of\\nthe mortgage. In October, 1974, Morvay\\ntransferred the mortgage to Dix for the\\npurpose of defending this suit.\\n\\nDrake contends that the mortgage is\\nvoid because he never received the $5,000\\nloan from Morvay. He claims that Dix\\ndefrauded him by promising him a $5,000\\nloan from Morvay in order to get Morvay\\nsecurity for Dix’s own $5,000 debt to Mor-\\n\\nvay. Since the mortgage was void, Drake\\ncontends that it could not be ratified by\\nthe agreement to stop the foreclosure pro-\\nceedings which the parties entered in 1972,\\n\\nDix contends that he never promised\\nDrake a loan from Morvay. The only\\ndebts which the mortgage secured were the\\n$4,050 prior debt plus the $950 which he\\nloaned Drake on the date of the mortgage.\\n(Drake denies receiving $950 and claims\\nhe only received an unsecured personal\\nloan of approximately $250.) Dix further\\ncontends that even if Drake did give the\\nmortgage to secure the promised but un-\\nconsummated loan from Morvay, Drake’s\\nsubsequent agreement with Dix stopping\\nthe foreclosure ratified the defect in the\\noriginal instrument. To support his ratifi-\\ncation theory, Dix cites Hughes v. Duke,\\n251 Ala. 220, 36 So.2d 300 (1948). The\\nHughes case, however, did not concern a\\nmortgage, but rather a deed which was\\nsought to be cancelled under Tit. 20, § 15,\\nCode, Tit. 20, § 15, which provides for a\\nright to rescind conveyances made upon a\\npromise of support, has no application to a\\nsituation in which no loan is received by a\\nmortgagor in consideration for his mort-\\ngage.\\n\\nHMM To analyze the ratification theo-\\nry, it is necessary to consider the nature of\\nthe defect which Dix claims was ratified.\\nIf Drake gave the mortgage to secure the\\npromised loan from Morvay, the defect is\\nthat the mortgagor received no considera-\\ntion for the obligation which the mortgage\\nsecured. This defect renders the mortgage\\na nullity in equity. Alabama law has long\\nrecognized the dual character of mortgages\\nas conveyances of estates in land at law\\nand security for debts in equity. Welsh v.\\nPhillips, 54 Ala. 309 (1875). The standard\\ntreatises on mortgages explain that the le-\\ngal mortgage itself does not require consid-\\neration because it is simply an executed\\nconveyance of real property. But, in equi-\\nty, a mortgage is a nullity except insofar\\nas it secures a valid obligation. Osborne,\\n\\n\\nHandbook on Law of Mortgages, § 107\\n(1951); 5 Tiffany, The Law of Real\\nProperty, § 1401 (1939). The usual state-\\nment of this rule in the Alabama cases is,\\n“Gf there is no debt there is no mortgage.”\\nJarrett v. Hagedorn, 237 Ala. 66, 185 So.\\n401 (1938); Lee v. Macon County Bank,\\n233 Ala, 522, 172 So. 662 (1937).\\n\\nHM Applying this rule to the Morvay-\\nDrake mortgage, we must conclude that\\nthe only way to cure the defect in the\\nmortgage was to create a debt for the\\nmortgage to secure. To do this, Morvay\\n(or Dix acting in Morvay’s behalf) must\\nhave actually loaned Drake $5,000 thereby\\nfulfilling the consideration for Drake’s ob-\\nligation to pay $5,000, Since the substance\\nof the agreement to stop foreclosure was\\nDrake’s paying money to Dix, the agree-\\nment was ineffective to ratify the mort-\\ngage from Drake to Morvay.\\n\\n[TMM The sole issue before this Court\\nis a factual one. What debt did the mort-\\ngage secure? If it secured a promised\\nbut unconsummated loan from Morvay to\\nDrake, the trial Judge is authorized to de-\\nclare the mortgage void for failure of con-\\nsideration. King Lumber Co. v. Spragner,\\n176 Ala. 564, 58 So. 920° (1912). If it se-\\ncured Drake’s prior debts to Dix plus the\\ndisputed $950 loan, then the mortgage is\\nvalid and may be foreclosed. There is am-\\nple evidence to support either conclusion.\\nThe trial Judge heard the evidence ore ten-\\nus and concluded that the foreclosure\\nshould be enjoined. Under our well-estab-\\nlished rules for review of ore tenus trials,\\nwe will not disturb the trial Court’s find-\\nings unless they are clearly and palpably\\nwrong or without supporting evidence, or\\nare manifestly unjust.

Simpson, Birmingham, for ap-\\npellant.\\n\\nHuie, Fernambucq, Stewart & Smith,\\nBirmingham, for appellee,\\n\\nJONES, Justice.\\n\\nDoes the executive director’s ignorance\\nof his corporation’s liability insurance cov-\\nerage excuse the corporation for not re-\\nporting an accident to the insurer as soon\\nas practicable when the executive director”\\nfailed to report the accident of which he\\nhad knowledge to the corporation’s Board\\nof Directors? Within the context in\\nwhich this issue is here presented and ar-\\ngued, we answer, “no.” We affirm.\\n\\nThe trial Court’s declaration of rights\\nfavorable to the insurer was based on a\\nstipulation of facts which we summarize as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\\nes =)\\n\\nOn August 12, 1972, James Bryan Layne,\\na minor, sustained personal injury to his\\nright eye while on the “BB” rifle firing\\nrange at Camp Jimmy Goodwin, a summer\\ncamp owned and operated by Birmingham\\nBoys’ Club, The Boys’ Club is a non-prof-\\nit charitable organization which operates a\\ncenter in Birmingham for underprivileged\\nboys and the summer camp.\\n\\nHerbert Peterson, the Executive Direc-\\ntor of the Boys’ Club, where he had been\\nemployed since 1948, was notified of the\\naccident immediately but he did not know\\nthat his employer carried liability insur-\\nance, He, therefore, did not notify any\\nmember of the Board of Directors or the\\ninsurance carrier, Transamerica Insurance\\nCompany. The first notice of the accident\\nto any executive officer, member of the\\nBoard of Directors, or officer of the Boys’\\nClub was receipt of suits filed by the in-\\njured minor and his father on April 11,\\n1973. Notice was immediately given to\\nTransamerica.4\\n\\nThe insurance policy contains the follow-\\ning condition:\\n\\n“INSURED’S DUTIES IN THE\\nEVENT OF OCCURRENCE, CLAIM\\nOR SUIT\\n\\n“In the event of an occurrence, written\\nnotice containing particulars sufficient to\\nidentify the insured and also reasonably\\nobtainable information with respect to\\nthe time, place and circumstances there-\\nof, and the names and addresses of the\\ninjured and of available witnesses, shall\\nbe given by or for the insured to the\\ncompany as soon as practicable.”\\n\\nHerbert Peterson had no decision-mak-\\ning powers and carried out ministerial acts\\nunder the direction of the Board of Direc-\\ntors of the Boys’ Club, He managed the\\nday center in Birmingham and reported to\\n\\n1. From the treatment accorded the stipula-\\ntion by both parties, it is apparent that the\\ninsurer had no notice of the accident from\\nany source prior to April 11, 1973.\\n\\n2. These statements are contained as factual ~\\n\\nconclusions in the stipulation of facts and\\n\\nthe Board of Directors. He was not an\\nexecutive officer, director, or officer of\\nthe corporation.® Therefore, contends the\\nBoys’ Club, notice to Mr. Peterson was not\\nnotice to the insured as he was not an ex-\\necutive officer, director or stockholder of\\nthe defendant corporation as the term “in-\\nsured” in the policy defines. .\\n\\nBefore we proceed, we deem it appropri-\\nate to emphasize the narrow context within\\nwhich the dispositive issue is here present-\\ned. Counsel for the Boys’ Club admits: 1)\\nThe eight-month period between the occur-\\nrence and the notice to Transamerica is\\nwithout factual dispute violative of the “as\\nsoon as practicable” condition of the poli-\\ncy; 2) prejudice vel non to the insurer re-\\nsulting from the delay of notice is not\\nraised as an issue; that is to say, we are\\nnot asked to revisit American Fire & Cas-\\nualty Company v. Tankersley, 270 Ala. 126,\\n116 So.2d 579 (1959).\\n\\nThe trial Judge correctly narrowed the\\nissue when he stated in his decree:\\n\\n“It is clear that the accident or occur-\\nrence was not reported as soon as practi-\\ncable if notice to Mr. Herbert Peterson,\\nExecutive Director of the Birmingham\\nBoys’ Club, was notice to the Birming-\\nham Boys’ Club.”\\n\\nThe position of the Boys’ Club is\\nsummed up in the following two para-\\ngraphs from its brief:\\n\\n“Since Peterson was not among those\\ndefined in the plaintiff\\'s policy as an in-\\nsured, there was no duty on him to noti-\\nfy the insurance carrier.\\n\\n“As Peterson did not know of any ex-\\nisting insurance coverage, he could not\\nbe expected or required to give notice\\nand the defendant is, therefore, excused\\nfrom the notice requirements in the poli-\\ncy.”\\n\\nare not legal issues for adjudication, We\\nexpress no opinion as to their legal veracity\\nnor as to Peterson\\'s status as an insured.\\n\\n\\n180\\n\\nHN The Boys’ Club’s assertion that\\nPeterson was not an insured under the\\nTransamerica policy is immaterial to this\\ncase, The controlling issue here is wheth-\\ner notice to Peterson is notice to the Boys’\\nClub, and the resolution of that issue is a\\nmatter of corporation and agency law.\\nThe only way to communicate actual notice\\nto a corporation is through its agents.\\nThus, a corporation is held responsible for\\nthe knowledge acquired by its agents while\\nacting within the scope of their employ-\\nment. Lawrence v. Tennessee Valley\\nBank, 224 Ala. 692, 141 So. 664 (1932);\\nTennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Pope, 21\\nAla.App. 183, 107 So. 735 (1925). There\\nis no question that Peterson, as Executive\\nDirector of the Boys’ Club and manager of\\nthe camp at which Layne was injured, was\\nthe agent responsible for receiving notice\\nof Layne’s injury on behalf of the corpora-\\ntion. Therefore, we must conclude that\\nthe Boys’ Club, a corporation, received no-\\ntice of Layne’s injury when Peterson re-\\nceived notice, Within the narrow context\\nhere presented, we hold that the trial Court\\ndid not err in upholding Transamerica’s\\ndefense to the Boys’ Club’s claim under the\\npolicy in question.\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

The\\nfacts, as contained in the opinion of that\\ncourt, are as follows:\\n\\n“Mrs. Wanda Smith Tate, wife of the\\ndeceased, Gordon Smith, testified that the\\n\\n\\n182\\n\\naround 9:30 p.m. She had just returned\\nhome from church when she was nearly\\nforced off the road by an on-coming car\\nwhich parked in front of her home as she\\ndrove into her carport. She immediately\\ntold her husband of the incident, and he\\ndrove their car down the driveway to\\nwhere the other automobile was parked.\\nMrs, Tate was then telephoning her sister-\\nin-law who lived across the street. She\\nthen went down the driveway on foot,\\nheard a voice, not her husband’s, cursing\\nloudly, then heard one shot and ran to her\\nwounded husband.\\n\\n“Mrs. Tate said she observed a person at\\nthe scene whom she had never before seen\\nand identified him as the appellant. She\\n\\n- said he ran to his automobile, ‘squeaked the\\ntires and sped off.’ Her brother-in-law,\\nJoe Beasley, and a neighbor, Hubert Sims,\\nwere at the scene when she reached her\\nhusband.\\n\\n“Dr. Joe W. O’Neal testified as to treat-\\ning the deceased around 10:30 p. m. on the\\nnight in question. He testified that Mr.\\nSmith died during the emergency treatment\\nfrom a gunshot wound in the neck.\\n\\n“Joe Beasley testified that his wife was\\nthe sister of the deceased and that he was\\nan eyewitness to the shooting. His wife\\nreceived a telephone call from the wife of\\nthe deceased and went outside. He then\\nwent out also and went down the driveway\\nto the road where two cars were sitting\\nside by side with a pickup truck parked to\\nthe rear of one. Hubert Sims was in the\\ntruck. Mr. Smith was standing beside the\\ntruck talking to Mr. Sims. .\\n\\n“The witness saw the appellant with a\\nrifle in his hands approach the deceased.\\nThe witness said he told the appellant to\\nput the gun up, and the appellant turned\\nthe gun on him saying, ‘You stay out of\\nthis you son of a bitch.’ He then observed\\nHunter walk up to the deceased, curse him\\nand jab him three or four times with the\\nrifle, He heard the deceased ask Hunter\\n\\nkilling took place on March 19, 1967,\\n\\nwhy he had followed his wife home,\\nwhereupon the appellant said he had not\\nfollowed her, that he had come for the\\nman across the street.\\n\\n“The witness said Hunter then cursed\\nSmith again saying, ‘I think I’ll just shoot\\nyou you smart son of a bitch,’ whereupon\\nhe raised the rifle, aimed at Smith’s neck\\nand shot him. Hunter then turned, ran to\\nhis car and sped away.\\n\\n“The witness did not hear Smith curse\\nHunter. He only heard one shot. His\\nbrother-in-law had a pistol in his hand\\nwhen Hunter shot him with the rifle, but\\nhe did not see Smith raise the pistol at any\\ntime. The witness took the pistol to his\\nhome where he and his wife emptied the\\nchambers, There were six chambers in the\\n.38 caliber pistol, but only five cartridges\\nand none had been fired. He put the pis-\\ntol and cartridges in a sack, and his wife\\nput them up. He did not tell the police\\nabout the pistol, nor give it to them.\\n\\n“Mrs. Madge Smith Beasley, sister of\\nthe deceased, was an eyewitness and saw\\nthe appellant shoot her brother. She testi-\\nfied to substantially the same facts as her\\nhusband.\\n\\n“Hubert Sims, a neighbor of the de-\\nceased, testified for the defense that as he\\nwas starting to work on the night in ques-\\ntion, he stopped his pickup truck behind\\ntwo cars which were blocking the road.\\nSmith, the deceased, came back to his\\ntruck with what appeared to be a gun in\\nhis hand and said the man in the other car\\nhad followed his wife home and that, ‘he\\nmight have to kill him, or was going to kill\\nhim, or something like that.’ He did not\\nremember the exact words Smith used.\\n\\n“He said the appellant then got out of\\nhis car with a .22 caliber rifle in hand and\\ncame back to where Smith was standing by\\nthe truck, There was an exchange of\\nwords, Hunter struck the deceased a couple\\nof times with the rifle. He did not hear\\nthe deceased ever curse the appellant, nor\\n\\n\\n183\\n\\ndid he see the deceased raise his pistol.\\nHe testified on cross examination that\\nHunter used words similar to the threat\\nJoe Beasley testified that Hunter made to\\nthe deceased. The appellant then stepped\\nback and shot Smith with the rifle. The\\nwitness only heard one shot fired.\\n\\n“The appellant, Robert Lee Hunter, tes-\\ntified in his own behalf. He said he was\\nparked just above the Smith’s driveway\\nwaiting on a man who lived across the\\nstreet, when the deceased pulled up in an-\\nother car and accused the appellant of fol-\\nlowing his wife home. Hunter denied it\\nand told him it was none of his business\\nwhat he was doing there as it was a public\\nstreet. Smith came around his car with a\\npistol, cursed Hunter, accusing him again\\nof following his wife, and shot into his\\ncar.\\n\\n“The pickup truck then arrived, and the\\ntestimony is substantially the same as al-\\nready set out, except that the appellant\\nclaims Smith raised his pistol, thereby\\ncausing the appellant to fire his rifle in\\nself-defense.\\n\\n“The appellant went home, talked to his\\nmother and a Mr. Gray and then drove to\\nthe Northport Police Station. His mother\\nJeft the station in the car, at the request of\\nthe police, and returned with the rifle.\\nPolice officers searched the car at the sta-\\ntion and were unable to find a bullet hole\\ninside that night. The next morning, ap-\\npellant’s mother showed investigating offi-\\ncers a bullet hole in the car. She testified\\nthat she did not fire a shot into the car to\\nmake the hole, A ballistics expert identi-\\nfied the slug as a .38 caliber, but due to its\\ncondition, it was impossible to determine\\nfrom which gun it was fired.”\\n\\nThe opinion states that a threat was\\nmade to petitioner-defendant at his auto-\\nmobile and the record reflects that the fol-\\nlowing transpired, viz:\\n\\n“He told me, he said, ‘You-son-of-a-\\nbitch you, said ‘you’ve been following\\n\\nmy wife and I’m going to kill you for it’\\nAnd he just pulled his pistol up there\\nand shot into my car.”\\n\\n* #0 ® * * *\\n\\n“A, When I was getting out I heard\\nthe man that shot into my car tell the\\nman in the truck that he—he made this\\nstatement: He said, ‘That son-of-a-bitch\\nhas been following my wife.’, and said,\\n‘I’m going to kill him for it?\\n\\n“Q.

State, 181 Ala. 28, 61\\nSo, 259 (1913).\\n\\nTM As to the conclusion that the\\nrefused charge gave “undue emphasis”\\n[“prominence”, Vol. 11A Alabama Digest\\nHomicide, €=300(6)], we cannot agree,\\nThe charge clearly states a proposition of\\nJaw in the form of a requested charge,\\ntwice held to have been a correct statement\\nof the law and to have been properly given\\nfor the state in Karr v. State, 100 Ala. 4,\\n14 So. 851 (1893); 106 Ala. 1, 17 So, 328\\n(1894). True, the Karr case, on its facts,\\nis different from the case at bar, but both\\nKarr and the present case involved the\\nquestion of “prior threats” and their rele-\\nvance with respect to a plea of self-de-\\nfense. It would appear that the Court of\\nCriminal Appeals has fallen into the error\\nof attempting to “weigh” the evidence—in\\nstating that other witnesses saw no overt\\nact and heard no threat. The question is\\nnot what is their, or our, view of the evi-\\ndence, but simply whether such evidence\\nwas presented. It was.\\n\\nNor can we agree with the Court of\\nCriminal Appeals that the charge was not\\nsupported by the evidence, ie, “abstract.”\\n\\nThe facts in the instant case are some-\\nwhat similar to the facts in the hundred-\\nyear-old case of Gilliam v. State, 50 Ala.\\n145 (1874). There, the armed deceased\\nwent to the house of the defendant and be-\\ngan a conversation and searched, as if for\\nsomething stolen, in the presence of de-\\nfendant’s family. Whereupon, he left but\\ncalled defendant to come out and defend-\\nant armed himself and went out, when,\\nbeing asked by defendant as to why he\\ntreated his family so, deceased replied,\\n“Damn you, go to shooting,” at this time\\nhandling his pistol. Defendant then slew\\nhim, The Court held certain instructions\\ndealing with self-defense ought to have\\nbeen given, reversing the judgment of con-\\nviction,\\n\\nIn the instant case, whether defendant\\nacted prudently in taking his rifle and\\ngoing up to deceased at the pickup is not\\ndecisive of his plea of self-defense. The\\njury might have found, if they believed his\\ntestimony, under proper instructions from\\n\\n\\n185\\n\\nthe court, that his conduct was free from\\ndesign to harm deceased, and was only for\\nthe purpose of asking why deceased shot at\\nhim. To sum up on this point, in language\\nparaphrased from Gilliam, supra, viz:\\n“The refusal of the charges may have\\nimpressed the jury with the belief that\\nthe defendant in going out [from his\\ncar] armed, forfeited any excuse for the\\nkilling, which the threatening attitude of\\nthe deceased would otherwise have given\\nhim.”\\nThe charge was clearly supported by the\\nevidence,\\n\\nHE The charge was not “misleading,”\\nhaving been held proper to give in Karr\\nboth times it was before this Court.\\n\\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals wrote\\nthat the court’s oral charge and given\\nCharge 28 “covered” this Charge 22.

For the\\nreason that this summary judgment is not\\na final judgment, the appeal is dismissed.\\n\\nPlaintiff ENCO. Engineering Corpora-\\n\\ntion filed suit to foreclose a mechanic\\'s.\\n\\nlien against defendants Nelson-American\\nDevelopers, Ltd., the Hoopers, Winn-Dixie\\nLouisiana, Inc., City National Bank of Mi-\\nami, Union Mutual Life Insurance Compa-\\nny, Revco Drug Store, Pizza Hut, Baldwin\\nCounty Title Company and Southern Thea-\\ntres of America.\\n\\nENCO’s claim of lien is based upon a *\\n\\ncontract between it (as the contractor) and\\nNelson-American (as the developer and\\nlong-term lessee of the real estate) to build\\n“Grant City Shopping Center” in Baldwin\\nCounty. The Hoopers are the owners of\\nthe real estate. City National Bank loaned\\nthe construction money. Union Mutual\\nLife is the permanent lender. The remain-\\ning defendants are tenants of Nelson-\\nAmerican in the shopping center and were\\njoined because of alleged deficiencies in\\nconstruction.\\n\\nAfter defendants’ motions to dismiss and\\nfor summary judgment were overruled, an-\\nswers were filed. Various other pleadings,\\nmotions, orders, affidavits and depositions\\nwere filed including a counterclaim by\\nNelson-American against ENCO.\\n\\nOn March 19, 1975, summary judgment\\nwas entered in favor of the contractor\\nENCO Engineering against the developer\\nNorth-American for $278,156.64. On May\\n\\n15, 1975, the court granted ENCO’s motion\\nfor summary judgment to establish a lien\\non the real estate to secure satisfaction of\\nthe summary judgment entered on March\\n19. On June 2, 1975, ENCO filed a mo-\\ntion requesting that the court amend its\\nsummary judgment of May 15 to state the\\npriorities of the parties to the lawsuit with\\nrespect to the lien, [The permanent loan\\nwas closed on July 15, 1974, by assignment\\nto Union Mutual Life of a mortgage from\\nNelson-American to City National Bank.]\\nAfter a hearing, the court, on June 17,\\n1975, amended its summary judgment of\\nMay 15 by giving the lien priority over the\\nmortgage.\\n\\nOn June 19, 1975, Nelson-American gave\\nnotice of appeal. Citation of appeal was\\nissued by the register and since perfected\\non ENCO and defendants Hooper. Only\\nthe developer and lessee Nelson-American\\nas appellant and the contractor ENCO as\\nappellee are parties to this appeal.\\n\\nHl Initially, appellee ENCO raises, by\\nmotion to dismiss the appeal, the lack of\\nservice of a citation of appeal on Defend-\\nant Union Mutual Life, whose rights as a\\nmortgagee of the suit property were deter-\\nmined adversely to it by the summary\\njudgment of June 17, 1975. Appelleé cites\\nTit. 7, § 804, Code 1940, which in pertinent\\npart reads:\\n\\n“§ 804. (6143) (2884) Summons or\\nnotice to parties who do not join in ap-\\npeal.—Any party against whom a judg-\\nment or decree is rendered, may individ-\\nually appeal to the supreme court or\\ncourt of appeals without taking the ap-\\npeal in the name of the other codefend-\\nant, but the clerk or register of the court\\nfrom which the appeal is‘ taken, shall is-\\nsue a summons when the appeal is so\\ntaken, to such as do not join in the ap-\\npeal to appear before the supreme court\\nor court of appeals at the time to which\\nthe appeal is returnable, and unite in\\nsaid appeal if he see proper, which sum-\\n\\n\\nmons may be served upon the party, or\\nhis attorney of record in the lower court.\\n\\nAppellee cites decisions of this Court to\\nthe effect that service of citation of ap-\\npeal, not waived, on a co-defendant ad-\\nversely affected by the judgment below, is\\nnecessary to the jurisdiction of the Su-\\npreme Court, and when the record fails to\\nshow service, the appeal should be dis-\\nmissed. See Pope v. Davis, 274 Ala. 201,\\n145 So.2d 717 (1962).\\n\\nAlthough heretofore this has been the\\ntule of our decisions, on April 23, 1973,\\nthis Court adopted Rule 52, 290 Ala, XVII,\\nwhich provides in pertinent part:\\n\\n“No appeal shall be dismissed . . .\\nwhere the transcript of the record on ap-\\npeal. . . (c) fails to show service of\\nnotice to parties who do not join in the\\nappeal under Tit. 7, § 804 (this notice\\nmay be ordered by this court after sub-\\nmission if deemed necessary), . . .\\nunless the failure . . has been\\ncalled to the attention of this court prior\\nto submission by written motion . . .\\nand the failure . . . remains uncor-\\nrected at time of submission . . ..”\\n\\nThe record shows that, after the motion\\nto dismiss was filed on October 24, 1975,\\nbut before submission, the appellant filed\\nherein a waiver of service of citation of\\nappeal by Union Mutual Life Insurance\\nCompany. Thus, the failure to serve the\\ncitation of appeal has been corrected in ac-\\ncordance with Rule 52 and the motion to\\ndismiss on that ground is due to be denied,\\n\\nHE Although we find no merit in ap-\\npellee’s motion to dismiss, we do find that\\nthe appeal must be dismissed by the Court\\nbut for a different reason.\\n\\nWe have carefully examined the three\\nsummary judgments, the original order of\\nMarch 19 and the two amendatory orders\\nof May 15 and June 17. Nowhere do we\\nfind therein any “express determination\\n\\n“101, 300 So.2d 359 (1974) ;\\n\\n187\\n\\nthat there is no just reason for delay and\\nupon an express direction for the entry of\\njudgment” in accordance with the mandate\\nof Rule $4(b) AR.CP.\\n\\nWhen there are multiple parties (as\\nhere) and multiple claims (as here) the\\nrule requires such determination and direc-\\ntion for the reason that the order entered\\nis interlocutory and “is subject to revision\\nat any time before a judgment which adju-\\ndicates all the rights and liabilities of all\\nthe parties. Because it is subject to revi-\\nsion, it is not a final judgment and will not\\nsupport an appeal.” Powell v. Republic\\nNational Life Insurance Co, et al., 293 Ala.\\nSee also Cates\\nv. Bush, 293 Ala. 535, 307 So.2d 6 (1975),\\nwhere the history of the rule is traced.\\n\\nWe think it clear here that this case\\npresents more than one claim for relief, as\\nwell as having multiple parties.\\n\\nAs we noted in Powell, supra, “[w]hen\\nit is determined thdt an order appealed\\nfrom is not a final judgment, it is the duty\\nof the Court to dismiss the appeal ex mero\\nmotu.”\\n\\nMoreover, as we wrote in Cates, supra,\\n“Tit. 7, Section 754, provides that. .\\nappeal must be only from a final judgment.\\nRule 54(b) merely sets out one instance\\nwhere a judgment may now be made final\\nalthough it would not have been final prior\\nto the adoption of the new rules.”\\n\\nIn conclusion, as we noted in Powell,\\n\\n“This holding’is not to be construed as\\ndepriving appellant of a review of the\\norder granting summary judgment by\\nappeal from the final judgment ultimate-\\nly entered in the cause nor as precluding\\nthe trial court from vacating its prior\\norder and entering one in conformity\\nwith Rule 54(b).

Defendant/appellant is Mobile\\nCounty Gas District, a corporation (Mo-\\nbile). We reverse and remand,\\n\\nNCR’s complaint claimed in count one\\n$15,626.75 for breach of contract for fail-\\nure to pay the balance due on a contract\\nallegedly fully performed by NCR. Count\\ntwo claimed the same amount due by item-\\nized verified account.\\n\\nMobile’s defenses were contained in five\\nseparate pleas. Pleas one and two were\\nthe general issue. Plea three alleged pay-\\nment. Plea four was to the effect that Mo-\\nbile was induced to enter the contract by\\nfraudulent misrepresentations made by NC\\nR. Plea five was in recoupment claiming\\n$30,000 for fraud and special damages\\n(other equipment and forms specially pur-\\nchased for use with NCR’s machine).\\n\\nThe issues raised on this appeal are:\\n(1) Was this case tried under Alabama\\nRules of Civil Procedure or under prior\\nprevailing procedures? (2) Did the trial\\ncourt err in giving certain written charges\\nrequested by NCR? (3) Did the trial\\ncourt err by admitting in evidence a ma-\\n\\n\\n190\\n\\nchine print-out and allowing explanatory\\ntestimony about it? (4) Did the trial\\ncourt err in overruling Mobile’s motion for\\na new trial?\\n\\nSince we find the procedures which ob-\\ntained before adoption of ARCP apply in\\nthis case and a given written jury instruc-\\ntion was improper and requires reversal,\\nwe pretermit discussion of the other issues.\\n\\nMobile entered into a contract with NCR\\nfor the purchase and installation of an au-\\ntomated billing machine which would also\\nprocess Mobile’s accounts payable and pay-\\nroll account. NCR installed the basic ma-\\nchine. There was contradictory testimony\\nabout whether the accessory equipment\\nnecessary to do accounts payable and pay-\\nrolls was installed. The facts further\\nshow that Mobile wanted a machine which\\ncould handle approximately 10,000 billings\\namonth. It is Mobile’s claim that they en-\\ntered into the contract because NCR’s\\nagents represented the machine had this\\ncapability. The testimony about what rep-\\nresentations were in fact made, is contra-\\ndictory. There is evidence that the ma-\\n\\n‘chine did not have the capability Mobile\\nneeded,\\n\\nIssue (1): Which Rules of Procedure\\nwere employed in the trial of the case?\\n\\nThe trial date was 26 October 1973.\\nHowever, before the jury retired this col-\\nloquy took place:\\n\\n“THE COURT: All right, sir. Now,\\nboth parties to the case has (sic) a right\\nto ask the Court to give to you written\\nrequested charges of the law. Now, this\\n(sic) are to be taken by you and consid-\\nered by you as correct propositions of\\nthe law. You will be able to take them\\ninto the Jury Room with you, we are\\nproceeding under the old rules, you un-\\nderstand?\\n\\n“MR. MARSAL: Yes, sir.\\n“MR. TYSON: Yes, sir.”\\n\\nMobile argues that these words indicate\\nthe entire case was tried under the old\\n\\nrules. NCR argues that the trial court’s\\ncomment was merely intended to allow the\\njury to take the written instructions to the\\njury room. NCR points out that the trial\\ndate is after the effective date of ARCP\\nand the trial court did not comply with\\nARCP 86 which requires a finding that ap-\\nplication of ARCP would not be feasible\\nor would work injustice. See Parker v.\\nMcGaha, Ala., 321 So.2d 182 (1975).\\n\\nHl A decision on this issue is a thresh-\\nold question since the giving of written\\njury charges is claimed as error. If the\\ntrial was conducted under formerly appli-\\ncable procedures then each charge is treat-\\ned as a separate entity apart from the\\ncourt’s oral charge. If trial proceeded un-\\nder ARCP then the written jury charges\\ncomplained of must be considered in light\\nof the court’s entire charge. Alabama\\nPower Co. v. Tatum, 293 Ala. 500, 306 So.\\n2d 251 (1975).\\n\\nHl As shown in the colloquy set out\\nsupra, the lawyers for both parties agreed\\nthat the jury in this case could take the\\nwritten charges into the jury room. This\\npractice was permissible only under our\\nformer civil procedure. Because the par-\\nties agreed that the old procedure in this\\nregard would apply, we hold they are es-\\ntopped to urge error from the failure of\\nthe trial court to comply with ARCP 86.\\nBy the parties own acts, the old procedure\\ncontrols. For the same reason NCR is es-\\ntopped to complain of the failure of Mobile\\nto object to the charges prior to the jury\\nretiring.\\n\\nIssue (2) The Written Jury Charges\\n\\nThe trial court gave, in addition to oth-\\ners, the following written charge:\\n\\n“Plaintiff\\'s Charge No. 18\\n\\n“The Court charges the jury that all\\nimplied warranties in a contract are ex-\\ncluded by language which in common un-\\nderstanding calls the buyer’s attention to\\nthe exclusion of warranties.”\\n\\n\\nHEM Such a charge is erroneous for it\\nwas given without instructing the jury on\\nits relation to the issue being litigated.\\nBateh v. Brown, 293 Ala. 704, 310 So.2d\\n186 (1975). Error resulting from the giv-\\ning of a misleading charge is harmless\\nwhere mere explanation would correct the\\nmisleading effect of it. Swindall v. Speig-\\nner, 283 Ala. 84, 214 So.2d 436. In such\\nan instance failure of the complaining par-\\nty to request explanatory charges would be\\nfatal. Alabama Power Co. v. Smith, 273\\nAla, 509, 142 So.2d 228. However, if the\\ndefective charge.is not capable of cure by\\nexplanations, failure to request explanatory\\ncharges can in no way prevent appellant\\nfrom complaining of reversible error from\\nthe giving of the offending charge. Rus-\\nsell v. Thomas, 278 Ala. 400, 178 So.2d\\n556. Plaintiff’s Charge No. 18 in this case\\nwas not curable by explanation. It is a\\nmisstatement of law. It is an absolute re-\\nquirement that, in a contract for the sale\\nof goods, the language excluding implied\\nwarranties must be so conspicuous as to be\\nclearly brought to the attention of the buy-\\ner, Code of Ala., Tit. 7A, § 2-316; Tiger\\nMotor Co. v. McMurtry, 284 Ala. 283, 224\\nSo.2d 638, Since No. 18 is clearly erro-\\nneous as a misstatement of the law, not\\ncurable, the judgment below must be re-\\nversed. Lucas v. Kirk, 275 Ala. 20, 151\\nSo.2d 744, .\\n\\nTH it is true generally that an erro-\\nneous charge given in writing, although\\nnot neutralized by a correct charge, should\\nbe interpreted in the light of the “inci-\\ndents” of the trial, including the court’s\\noral charge, to determine if the written\\ncharge as given was prejudicial. Western\\nUnion’ Telegraph Co. v. Gorman, 237 Ala.\\n146, 185 So. 743, The “incidents” of the\\ntrial of this case including other given\\nwritten charges and the oral charge of the\\n\\ntrial court fail to mitigate the error of |\\n\\nPlaintiff\\'s Charge No. 18 Rather they\\nsubstantially augment the confusion under\\nwhich the jury undoubtedly labored.\\n\\nHl As in Parker, supra, we see no rea-\\nson why this case cannot be tried under\\n\\n191\\n\\nARCP upon remand unless the trial court\\nspecifically finds that application of ARCP\\nwould not be feasible or would work an in-\\njustice. The reasons for such finding must\\nbe set forth in the record. Parker, supra.\\n\\nReversed and remanded.\\n\\nBLOODWORTH, FAULKNER and\\n\\nALMON, JJ., concur,\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Thiry, Mobile, for appellant\\nand cross-appellee.\\n\\n\\n| 193\\nLe .\\n\\nleges (1) the court erred in construing the\\nfuture advance clause of a mortgage exe-\\ncuted by Claude Gross, and Lee Anne\\nGross, to the Bank on September 11, 1969,\\nand (2) the court erred in holding that a\\nmortgage executed by the Grosses, on Feb-\\nruary 26, 1971, did not cancel the debt se-\\ncured by the 1969 mortgage. The Bank\\ncross-appeals from an order denying its\\nmotion to dismiss the appeal. We affirm\\nin part, and reverse in part.\\n\\nThe Facts\\n\\nOn September 11, 1969, the Grosses bor-\\nrowed $3,500 for business purposes from\\n. the Bank, signed a note, and executed a\\nReynolds & Lauten, Mobile, for appellee mortgage on their home in Bay Minette.\\n\\nand cross-appellant. The mortgage was on a printed form con-\\n\\ntaining a future advance clause, styled\\n“dragnet” or “anaconda” by Malkove.\\nThis mortgage was recorded on September\\n16, and was not cancelled at the time the\\ncase was tried,\\n\\nSubsequent to this loan, the Grosses in-\\ncurred additional obligations to the Bank\\nthat included three installment loans, a\\nBankAmericard account, and a signature\\nloan, Apparently the financial fortunes of\\nthe Grosses grew markedly worse, and they\\nmoved to Miami. Threatened with fore-\\nclosure of the 1969 mortgage, the Grosses\\ncame to Mobile in 1971, and on February\\n26, executed a second mortgage to the\\nBank covering the balance of the original\\nmortgage loan, and the subsequent indebt-\\nedness. A disclosure statement was given\\nto the Grosses indicating their home was\\nthe security for their debt to the Bank.\\n\\n| ‘This mortgage, providing for 35 monthly\\npayments commencing April 5, 1971, and\\none balloon payment payable on March 5,\\n1974, was not recorded until June 10.\\nMeanwhile, Malkove filed suit against the\\nGrosses on April 8, attaching the property,\\nand recording a lis pendens notice. Judg-\\n\\nment was rendered against the Grosses on\\n: July 1. Malkove brought the property at\\nFAULKNER, Justice, the sheriff\\'s sale, and recorded the deed on\\nMalkove appeals from a judgment of the September 30. On October 26, he notified\\nCireuit Court of Mobile County. He al- the Bank of his interest in the property\\nas\\n\\n\\n194\\n\\nand demanded the amount for redemption.\\nThe Bank disputed Malkove’s claim of su-\\nperiority of rights, and announced its in-\\ntent to foreclose. Malkove filed his bill\\nfor declaratory judgment on December 15,\\nand the Bank foreclosed on January 13,\\n1972, the same day it received Malkove’s\\ncomplaint.\\n\\nContention of the Parties\\n\\n1, Malkove\\n\\nThe main thrust of Malkove’s argument\\nat the trial was that the second mortgage\\nworked a novation of the first mortgage.\\nAnd, since the second mortgage was re-\\ncorded subsequent to the lis pendens notice,\\nhe should have prevailed. Malkove argues\\nfurther, if the second mortgage did not\\nwork a novation, then the first secured\\nonly the principal debt. He attacks the\\nBank for seemingly relying on the second\\nmortgage to all of the Grosses’ debts, then\\nshifting its reliance on the first mortgage.\\n\\n2. The Bank\\n\\nThe Bank argues that the second mort-\\ngage was a renewal, a consolidation, and\\nan extension of the first mortgage. It\\nsays the future advance clauses are accept-\\nable in Alabama, and the intent of the par-\\nties was to cover all indebtedness of the\\nGrosses in the first mortgage. Moreover,\\nthe second mortgage did not work a nova-\\ntion of the first.\\n\\nThe Mortgage Clauses\\n\\n1, The Consideration Clause\\n\\n“KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE\\nPRESENTS, that CLAUDE EUGENE\\nGROSS and LEE ANNE GROSS, hus-\\nband and wife, (hereinafter called ‘mortga-\\ngor’), in consideration of THREE THOU-\\nSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NO/100\\n($3,500.00) DOLLARS hereby acknowl-\\nedged to have been paid to said mortgagors\\nby THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF\\nMOBILE,’ MOBILE, ALABAMA, (here-\\ninafter called ‘mortgagee’), and in order to\\n\\nsecure the repayment of all amounts here-\\ntofore, herewith or hereafter owed by\\nmortgagor to mortgagee, at any time be-\\nfore actual cancellation of this instrument\\non the records in the office of the Judge\\nof Probate of Baldwin County, Alabama,\\nor the foreclosure thereof, do hereby grant,\\nbargain, sell and convey unto the mortga-\\ngee all that real property in the County. of\\nBaldwin, State of Alabama, described as\\nfollows: * * *”\\n\\n2. The Defeasance Clause\\n\\n“Providing always, and these presents\\nare upon the express condition, that if the\\nmortgagor shall well and truly pay to the\\nmortgagee the said sum of $3,500.00 with\\ninterest thereon according to the tenor and\\neffect of that certain waiver of exemption\\npromissory note bearing even date and\\npayable as follows: * * * said note\\nbeing payable to the mortgagee at The\\nFirst National Bank of Mobile, in Mobile,\\nAlabama; and if the mortgagor shall per-\\nform all the covenants and agreements\\nherein contained, then these presents shall\\nbe void; otherwise they shall remain in\\nfull force and effect.”\\n\\nAdvance Clause\\n\\n“In addition to the aforesaid indebted-\\nness and any and all extensions or renew-\\nals of the same or any part thereof, this\\ninstrument is intended to and does secure\\nany and all debts, obligations, or liability\\ndirect or contingent, of mortgagor to mort-\\ngagee, whether now existing or hereafter\\narising at any time before actual cancella-\\ntion of this mortgage on the Probate Rec-\\nords of Baldwin County, Alabama, or\\nforeclosure thereof, and whether the same\\nbe evidenced by note, open account, guar-\\nanty, pledge or, otherwise.”\\n\\nOpinion and Conclusion\\n\\nHM Were the debts incurred after the\\nexecution of the 1969 mortgage secured by\\nthe advance clause? We are of the opin-\\nion they were not. Whether other debts\\n\\n195\\n\\nbetween the same parties are secure under\\nthe advance clause depends on the inten-\\ntion of the parties.

In\\nBain this court stated, “If a debtor owes\\nseveral notes, and gives a mortgage ex-\\npressly securing one, any intention to cover\\nother existing notes should be quite clear\\nand explicit . . .”\\n\\n[TH In this case we find the defeasance\\nclause provides that “. . . if the mort-\\ngagor shall well and truly pay to the mort-\\ngagee the said sum of $3,500.00 with inter-\\nest . . .” Bain says a defeasance\\nclause is intended to define the terms and\\nconditions upon which a mortgage shall be\\nsatisfied, cease to be security for the debt,\\nand become void, The clause may be mis-\\nleading unless it indicates the debts to be\\npaid before the mortgage ceases to be ef-\\nfective as security.\\n\\nIn Bain the defeasance clause read:\\n\\n“Upon condition, however that upon\\nthe payment of the indebtedness hereby\\nsecured, this conveyance to be void, pay-\\nment of taxes and insurance, the satis-\\nfaction-of prior incumbrances and other\\nloans and advances to the mortgagor by\\nthe mortgagee before the full settlement\\nand payment of this mortgage and all\\nexpenses of recording are to be a part of\\nthis mortgage indebtedness.’” (Empha-\\nsis added.)\\n\\nCf.

First Na-\\ntional Bank of Opelika, 279 Ala. 303, 184\\nSo.2d 815 (1966).\\n\\nIf the parties had intended the 1969\\nmortgage to include other loans, it would\\nhave been a simple matter to draft their\\nintent in it. Furthermore, if they had in-\\ntended coverage of other obligations in the\\n1969 mortgage, there would have been no\\n\\nnecessity to have the 1971 mortgage exe-\\ncuted. Construing the consideration clause\\nand defeasance clause, we are of the opin-\\nion that the defeasance clause controls and\\nprecludes any other debts being secured\\nunder the 1969 mortgage.\\n\\nNovation\\n\\nHE Novation involves three or more\\nparties and consists of four requisites: 1.\\nA previous valid obligation; 2. the\\nagreement of the parties to the new con-\\ntract; 3, the cancellation of the old con-\\ntract; and 4, validity of the new contract.\\nA, M.

Meanwhile\\non December 23, the Bank objected to the\\n\\n\\n196\\n\\nextension of December 12, and moved to\\nhave it set aside. The Bank alleged that\\nthe court reporter had moved out of Mo-\\nbile, could not find his notes, and was un-\\nable to transcribe the testimony. The\\nBank’s second reason for objecting to the\\nextension was that the property was deteri-\\norating. Before this motion was heard,\\nthe trial court granted another extension\\nuntil February 12. On January 31, the\\ncourt denied the Bank’s motion to set aside\\nthe extensions of December 12 and Janu-\\nary 10. On February 7 another extension\\nwas granted until March 14. The report-\\ner’s transcript was filed on March 3. The\\nBank filed motions to set aside the exten-\\nsion orders on February 27 and March 10.\\nBoth were denied. The transcript of the\\nrecord was filed in this court on April 23.\\n\\nWe cannot say the trial judge abused his\\ndiscretion. Regarding the extensions, this\\nis what the trial judge said: .\\n\\n“THE COURT: Let me say it for the\\nrecord now, we want to make this clear,\\nback in June, I think it was, I got notice\\nfrom the Court Reporter then, the one\\nwe are talking about, his physicians had\\nstated to me that if he continued report-\\ning cases he was going to suffer a men-\\ntal relapse, a nervous breakdown. So, I\\nimmediately stopped any further activi-\\nties in requiring him to report any cases.\\nWe have—for the two and a half years\\nhe has been with me, we have had, I\\nthink, a considerable amount of trial cas-\\nes and he was actually my third reporter\\nsince I have been a Judge, and they have\\nall quit due to nervous exhaustion.

He fails in that regard.\\nHe contends that the letter written by the\\nphysician sued in O’Barr left the decision\\nto commit or not to commit to the probate\\njudge. He says that the affidavit signed\\nby Dr. Faget in this case removes any dis-\\ncretion from the probate judge. We disa-\\ngree. Dr. Faget’s affidavit is as follows:\\n\\n“I, Dr. Guy E. Faget of the County of ,\\n\\nMobile and State of Alabama, being duly\\nsworn according to law, do certify and\\ndeclare that I have examined into the\\nstate of health and mental condition of\\nPaul Lincoln Snyder of the said County\\nof Mobile and that my opinion is that he\\nis insane.”\\n\\nWithout going into all of the different\\nexpressions of opinion in O’Barr, supra, it\\nappears that there was a concensus that:\\n\\n“. . . the statutes for commitment\\n\\nplace the decision making power entirely\\nwithin the sound discretion of the pro-\\nbate judge. . . . The physician is no\\nmore than a witness in the proceeding\\nand he has no authoritative means to\\nforetell that the probate judge will act in\\naccordance with his report and commit\\nthe appellant. The judge is free of any\\nobligation to follow the physician’s con-\\nclusions, . . .” (292 Ala. at 449, 296\\nSo.2d at 160)\\n\\nO’Barr also held that commitment pro-\\nceedings were judicial in nature, and, as\\nsuch, afforded the physician with absolute\\nimmunity as to the negligence count, as\\nwell as to the counts sounding in libel and\\nfalse imprisonment,\\n\\nI We sce no distinction between the\\nletter written by Dr. Feist, set out in\\nO’Barr, and the statement signed by Dr.\\nFaget in the instant case. In both in-\\nstances, they amount to no more than a\\n\\nmedical opinion of the patient’s mental\\ncondition. Each was made in the course\\nof a judicial proceeding; and as the opin-\\nion offered was relevant to those proceed-\\nings, they are clothed with privilege and,\\ntherefore, cannot serve as a basis for an\\naction for damages based upon negligence.\\n\\nHM Some states have held that certify-\\ning physicians who act as witnesses in\\ncommitment proceedings are civilly liable\\nfor negligently certifying that the plaintiff\\nis insane. Others, and Alabama has joined\\ntheir ranks in O’Barr, take the position\\nthat the physician is immune from liability\\non the ground that the statement is one\\nmade in the process of a judicial proceed-\\ning.

In\\nthat case, the president of an insurance\\ncompany denied, under oath in a judicial\\nproceeding, that there was a liability policy\\ncovering the insured.

It is also true that\\nthe acts asserted in the complaint relied\\nupon for recovery, if established, consti-\\ntute perjury, but it does not follow\\ntherefrom that a civil action in tort for\\ndamages may not be predicated upon\\nsuch testimony if all elements necessary\\nto maintain such. an action are present.\\n+ + 4” (228 F.2d at 627, 54 A.L.R.2d\\nat 1295)\\n\\nFrist v. Gallant, 240 F.Supp. 827 (W.D.\\nS.C.1965), involved a suit by a wife\\n\\na |\\n\\nagainst-her husband and his father charg-\\ning that they conspired to give, and did\\ngive, false and fraudulent testimony in a\\nprior suit for separate maintenance\\nbrought by her against her husband, with a\\npurposeful and preconceived intent to de-\\nfraud the plaintiff of the just amount of\\nalimony to which she was entitled.

Missouri Pacif-\\nic Transp. Co., 85 F.Supp. 235 (W.D.Ark.\\n1949), a conspiracy was alleged to wrong-\\nfully deprive the plaintiff of the right to\\nearn a living. There, the court said that,\\nas a general rule, no cause of action exists\\nfor subornation of perjury and stated the\\nreason for the rule:\\n\\n“\\n\\n. For reasons of public policy\\nsuch a cause of action has generally\\nbeen denied in order to protect the prop-\\ner functioning of the courts by enabling\\nwitnesses to make full and complete dis-\\nclosures in their testimony without the\\nrestraint or fear of subsequent suits for\\ndamages, and therefore, an action for\\ndamages for conspiracy to commit perju-\\nry cannot ordinarily be maintained.\\n\\n“However, the complaints in the in-\\nstant cases may be held to state a cause\\nof action without running afoul of the\\ngenerally accepted prohibition against\\ncivil actions for perjury or conspiracy to\\ncommit perjury or to suborn perjury.\\nThe conspiracy alleged was to deprive\\nwrongfully the plaintiffs of their rights\\nto earn a living for themselves and their\\nfamilies according to their desires as to\\n\\n\\n203\\n\\nchoice and availability of employment.\\nAny fraudulent invasion of that right\\nthat causes damage is a tort and the\\ndamaged person has a cause of action.\\nAccording to the allegations of the com-\\nplaints this conspiracy was carried out\\nby a series of overt acts, and the procur-\\ning and the giving of perjured testimony\\nat the hearing prior to final discharge\\nwas an incident to the alleged fraud of\\ndefendant against the plaintiffs. Thus it\\nis at least possible that the allegations\\nmay be deemed sufficient to charge an\\nactionable invasion of a right of the\\nplaintiffs through the violation of a duty\\nof the defendants owing to the plaintiffs,\\nthe violation occurring by reason of the\\novert acts of defendants to bring about\\nthe wrongful discharge of the plaintiffs\\nin the furtherance of the conspiracy to\\nthat effect. . . .” (85 F.Supp. at\\n238)\\n\\nAlso, in Oldham v. McRoberts, 37 Misc.\\n2d 979, 237 N.Y.S.2d 26, 31 (1962), a New\\nYork Court recognized the existence of a\\ncivil action for fraud and deceit based on\\nconspiracy “. . . where the fraud is\\nbrought to a successful end by false testi-\\nmony . .” That court held that a con-\\nspiracy had been alleged with the perjury\\nonly a step to accomplish it.\\n\\nWe are mindful of the policy reasons for\\nthe general rule, which denies a right of\\naction based upon testimony offered in a\\njudicial proceeding, and are in agreement\\nwith that policy. However, the rule of im-\\nmunity cannot be absolute.\\n\\nSuppose, for example, that two or more\\npersons deliberately and consciously agreed\\nwith each other to fraudulently deprive a\\nnamed beneficiary of the proceeds of a tes-\\ntator’s estate. To succeed in this effort, it\\nis necessary to invalidate the will of the\\ntestator. Once admitted to probate, the\\nonly way a will may be invalidated is\\nthrough a judicial-proceeding. If the con-\\ntestants are successful in their efforts to\\ndefeat the will by falsely testifying that\\nthe testator lacked testamentary capacity,\\n\\nfor example, they should not be permitted\\nto claim judicial privilege. Their perjury\\nwas but a step in the scheme to deprive the\\nbeneficiary of the proceeds of the estate.\\nThe fact that the only vehicle for carrying\\nout the scheme was through a judicial pro-\\nceeding should not prevent the beneficiary\\nfrom recovering from them the resulting\\ndamage, assuming he can prove all of the\\nelements necessary to an action of conspir-\\nacy.\\n\\nHl [n the instant case, the allegations\\nare that the defendants conspired to\\ndeprive the plaintiff of his liberty and\\nproperty by falsely and fraudulently having\\nhim committed to a mental institution. We\\ndo not think the general policy reason be-\\nhind the rule extending immunity to suits,\\nbased upon testimony offered in a judicial\\nproceeding, is defeated by allowing the\\nplaintiff an opportunity to attempt to prove\\nwhat he has alleged—a conspiracy by the\\ndefendants to fraudulently deprive him of\\nhis liberty and property.\\n\\nHl it is not unlawful to express an\\nopinion as to one’s sanity or insanity under\\nproper circumstances. It is likewise not\\nunlawful to commit one to a mental insti-\\ntution where proper procedures are fol-\\nlowed. But, it is improper to frauduiently\\nconspire to deprive a person of his liberty\\nor property; and such conduct. is civilly\\nactionable where the plaintiff suffers dam-\\nages as a result thereof.\\n\\nHI Obviously, the plaintiff has the\\nburden of proof, and must establish every\\nelement of the tort alleged. In Jolowicz &\\nLewis, Winfield on Torts, Conspiracy 557,\\n559, 560 (8th ed. 1967), the necessary ele-\\nments are summarized as follows:\\n\\n“(a) Purpose. The most important\\nfeature of a tortious conspiracy where\\nunlawful means are not used is that the\\nobject or purpose of the combination\\nmust be to cause damage to the plaintiff.\\nIt is not a matter of ‘intention’ as that\\nword is normally used in the law, for in-\\n\\n\\n204\\n\\ntention signifies not what a person is\\naiming at but what may reasonably be\\nexpected to flow from what he does,\\nwhile for conspiracy the test is ‘what is\\nin truth the object in the minds of the\\ncombiners when they acted as they did.’\\nMalice in the sense of malevolence, spite\\nor ill-will is not an essential for liability ;\\nwhat is required is that the combiners\\nshould have acted in order that (not so\\nthat) the plaintiff should suffer dam-\\nage. If they did not act in order that\\nthe plaintiff should suffer damage\\nthey are not liable, however selfish their\\nattitude and however inevitable the\\nplaintiff’s damage may have been.\\n“«\\n\\n“(b) Combination, There must, of\\ncourse, be concerted action between two\\nor more persons...\\n\\n“(c) Overt act causing damage.\\n+ an overt act causing damage is\\nan essential of liability in tort. . . .”\\n\\nThis case is here on the pleadings, The\\ndefendants have been granted their motion\\nto dismiss. The only question before us is\\nwhether the complaint states a claim upon\\nwhich relief can be granted. It does. Ob-\\nviously, the plaintiff will have a considera-\\nble burden, perhaps an insurmountable one,\\nin proving the elements of the tort alleged.\\nHe cannot recover on proof that he was,\\nthrough negligence or ill will, committed to\\na mental institution. He must prove all of\\nthe elements set out above.\\n\\nHHL Regardless of how unlikely it ap-\\npears that the plaintiff will be successful\\nin his efforts to make out a case on proof,\\nunder our procedure he is entitled to the\\nattempt, where his complaint states some\\nlegal theory which will support a claim for\\nrelief. We believe that the conspiracy\\nclaim in this case meets that test.\\n\\nThe judgment appealed from is, there-\\nfore, reversed and the cause is hereby re-\\nmanded.\\n\\nReversed and remanded.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Gen.,\\nTroy, for appellant,\\n\\n\\nHEFLIN, Chief Justice.\\n\\nThe State of Alabama brings this appeal\\nfrom a final judgment of $16,000 in favor\\nof appellee in a proceeding to condemn\\ncertain land owned by appellees for use as\\npart of a highway right of way. The\\njudgment is affirmed.\\n\\nIn the trial of this cause in the Circuit\\nCourt of Pike County, it was stipulated by\\nthe parties that the only issue to be tried\\nand determined by the court was the\\namount of compensation to be paid to ap-\\npellees.\\n\\nThe appellees, Colley Corporation and\\nother named individuals, owned a 9.07 acre\\ntract of property which fronted on U.S.\\nHighway 231 near the city of Troy, Ala-\\nbama. The State sought to condemn 0.19\\nacres of this tract for use as a deceleration\\nJane on Highway 231. This highway was\\nfrequently referred to as the “by-pass” or\\nthe “Troy by-pass.”\\n\\nAn expert witness for the State present-\\ned his opinion that the value of the 9.07\\nacre tract prior to the taking was\\n$118,000.00 and that it was worth\\n$115,500.00 after the taking, resulting in\\ndamages to defendant-appellees of $2,500.-\\n00. Upon cross examination, appellees’ at-\\ntorney asked this witness if he had consid-\\nered sales of other properties in arriving at\\nhis appraisal of damages due appellees.\\nAmong several sales which the expert\\nmentioned was “a sale from Shaw to Dunn\\n* * * that consisted of 18.6 acres of\\nland at the intersection of the by-pass and\\nAlabama No. 87 * * *” Following\\nfurther questioning on the sales mentioned,\\nthe expert witness was asked, “Are you fa-\\nmiliar with the sale on June 28, 1974, from\\nWoodard, A. P. Woodard and Bobby Wood-\\nard to McDonald Corporation—0.46 of an\\nacre on 231 By-pass just east of the Dunn\\nproperty that you are speaking of?” This\\nquestion was objected to on the ground\\nthat this sale did not involve property com-\\nparable to that being condemned. The\\nsame objection was raised to introduction\\n\\n207\\n\\nof evidence regarding a second sale to\\nMcDonald Corporation of a .58 acre tract\\nadjacent to the McArthur property. The\\noverruling of these objections by the trial\\ncourt constitutes one of the major conten-\\ntions of the State’s assignments of error.\\nThe State on appeal contends that the trial\\ncourt erred in admitting into evidence the\\ntwo sales to McDonald Corporation on the\\nground that neither involved property com-\\nparable to the lands taken in the proceed-\\ning. Further it contends that the verdict\\nreturned was excessive and the result of\\nbias, passion and prejudice.\\n\\nI Ina land condemnation proceeding\\nevidence of the sale price of another piece\\nof land is admissible in determining the\\nvalue of the condemned land. The criteria\\nof admissibility are: (1) the sale was vol-\\nuntary; (2) conditions surrounding the\\ntwo tracts are similar; and (3) the sale\\nwas neither too remote in point of time\\nnor of such a character as to indicate that\\nit did not represent the true value of the\\nproperty.

Leibacher, su-\\npra.\\n\\nTHM The State contends that the Mc-\\nDonald’s sales are not of similar character\\n\\n\\n208\\n\\nor condition to the property subject to the\\nproceeding in that the commercial develop-\\nment of the two locations is different.\\nThe State argues that the McDonald’s\\nproperty is near the Troy State University\\ncampus in an area characterized by “fast\\nfood” restaurants which are frequented by\\nstudents from the University. The Colley\\nproperty, on the other hand, is surrounded\\nby automobile and heavy equipment dealer-\\nships. These facts were before the trial\\ncourt, as was the fact that the State’s ex-\\npert witness considered a sale within a\\nblock of the McDonald’s property in his\\nappraisal of the condemned property. The\\ntwo tracts of land were shown to be on the\\nsame by-pass highway, within 2.8 miles of\\neach other. It was also shown that there\\nwas at least one restaurant and a motel\\nwithin the vicinity of the Colley property.\\nBased on this evidence this court finds no\\nabuse of the trial court’s discretion in its\\ndecision to allow testimony regarding the\\nMcDonald sales into evidence,\\n\\nTM The State also argues that the\\nproperties were dissimilar because the\\nMcDonald’s sales involved parcels much\\nsmaller than the landowners’ 9,07 acre\\ntract. This court has addressed this same\\nargument in the cases of State v. Wise De-\\nvelopment Corporation, supra, and State v.\\nBusby, 293 Ala. 510, 306 So.2d 260 (1975).\\nIn both cases, the court overruled the\\nState’s argument on the ground that “the\\ntracts were clearly ‘comparable’ in size to\\nthe tracts actually taken by the State and\\nit was within the trial court’s discretion to\\nadmit evidence of such sales on the ques-\\ntion of the value of the part actually tak-\\nen.” 293 Ala, at 675, 309 So.2d at 451. In\\nthe present case, this court cannot say that\\nthe trial judge abused his discretion in de-\\ntermining that the sales offered into evi-\\ndence were sufficiently comparable in size\\nto the portion of appellees’ property actual-\\nly taken,\\n\\nHI The State contends in brief that\\nthe properties were dissimilar because the\\n\\nMcDonald’s property was located in a sub-\\ndivision and involved platted land. This\\ncourt has noted that courts of some other\\nstates have held that sales of platted land\\ncannot be used to determine the value of\\nunplatted land. See Southern Electric\\nGenerating Co. v. Leibacher, supra. The\\ncourt has never held that the fact that one\\ntract is platted and the other is not is suf-\\nficient in and of itself to require a finding\\nof dissimilarity. This fact is just oné to\\nbe considered in the trial court’s determi-\\nnation. Southern Electric Generating Co.\\nv. Leibacher, supra. This court further\\nfinds that the fact that one tract has been *\\nsubdivided while the other has not is again\\nonly a consideration in the court’s determi-\\nnation of similarity. Cf State v. Mc-\\nDaniel, 285 Ala. 310, 231 So.2d 878 (1970)\\n(where the court allowed into evidence ap-\\npraisals based on valuation for business\\nuses of property zoned residential) ; Cown-\\nty Board of Education of Jefferson County\\nv. McCarter, 281 Ala. 679, 207 So.2d 664\\n(1968) (where the court allowed appraisal\\nof property based on its value as subdivi-\\nsion where the property at the time of the\\ncondemnation proceeding had not been\\nplatted for lots).\\n\\nHSAs its final assignment of error,\\nthe State argues that the trial court erred\\nin overruling the motion for new trial be-\\ncause the jury verdict of $16,000 was so\\nexcessive as to indicate that it was the re-\\nsult of bias, passion and prejudice. Testi-\\nmony offered by the expert witnesses as to\\nthe damage suffered by the property own-\\ners from the taking varied from a low esti-\\nmate of $2,500 to a high estimate of\\n$30,000, thus making the jury’s verdict\\nwithin the range of estimates in evidence.\\nThe evidence reflected that the sales price\\nfor the McDonald sales was $46,500 each.\\nThe duty of the trier of fact in condemna-\\ntion cases is to reconcile the various opin-\\nions as best it can by analyzing the evi-\\ndence in light of its common knowledge,\\nRountree Farm Co. v. Morgan County, 249\\nAla. 472, 476, 31 So.2d 346, 350 (1947).\\n\\nThe jury’s conclusion is to be given great\\nweight. State v. Rigas, 282 Ala. 541, 213\\nSo.2d 386 (1968). Further this court must\\naffirm the trial court’s action in overruling\\na motion for new trial unless the verdict is\\nunsupported by competent evidence or is\\nagainst the preponderance of the evidence,\\nor is palpably wrong or manifestly unjust.\\nState v.

That order of APSC\\ndenied approval of the transfer of the\\nrights under the intrastate Certificate of\\nAuthority of A-OK Motor Lines, Inc, a\\nbankrupt carrier of freight by motor truck.\\nThe applicants seeking approval of the\\ntransfer of A-OK’s authority were the\\nTrustee In Bankruptcy of A-OK Motor\\nLines, The Mason and Dixon Lines, Inc.,\\nCooper Transfer Company, Inc., Gordons\\nTransports, Inc., and Reliable Truck Lines,\\nInc. Mason and Dixon sought approval to\\npurchase A-OK’s regular route authority.\\nReliable Cooper and Gordons each sought\\napproval to purchase a portion of A-OK’s\\nirregular route authority.\\n\\nThe applications for approval of the sale\\nof A-OK’s authority were protested by\\neleven carriers: Ross Nelly Express, Inc.,\\nBirmingham-Nashville Express, Inc. Cen-\\ntral Motor Express, Hornady Brothers\\nTruck Line, Floyd & Beasley Transfer Co.,\\nInc., Bowman Transportation, Inc., Geor-\\ngia-Florida-Alabama Transportation Co.,\\nInc., Hiller Truck Lines,’ Inc., North Ala-\\nbama Express, Inc., Bee Line Express, and\\nBaggett Transportation Company.\\n\\nFollowing a consolidated hearing, APSC\\ndenied approval of the transfer applica-\\ntions as not consistent with the public in-\\nterest. See Code of Ala, Tit. 48, §\\n301(15). The applicants perfected an ap-\\npeal to the Circuit Court of Covington\\nCounty. That court found that APSC\\nerred to the prejudice of applicants’ sub-\\nstantial rights in its application of law to\\nthe facts and the findings of APSC were\\nnot based on substantial evidence. Accord-\\ningly, the court entered its judgment set-\\n\\nting aside the order of the Commission and\\nremanding the case to APSC with direc-\\ntions that the Commission grant approval\\nof. the applications for sale and transfer of\\nA-OK’s authority. The court further or-\\ndered that costs be taxed against the pro-\\ntestants. We reverse and remand with\\ndirections,\\n\\nThe following definitions may be help-\\nful:\\n\\nROUTE: Particular road or highway,\\nor series of roads or highways, over which\\na carrier is authorized by APSC to operate\\nits vehicles between terminal. points.\\n\\nREGULAR ROUTE AUTHORITY:\\n‘Authority to carry goods in a scheduled\\noperation over a restricted and defined\\nroute.\\n\\nIRREGULAR ROUTE AUTHORITY:\\n\\n“Authority to carry goods in an unscheduled\\n\\noperation within a restricted territory but\\nwholly unrestricted as to route. Carriage\\nunder radial authority means carriage to or\\nfrom a base point to or from any point in\\nthe restricted territory. Non radial au-\\nthority means carriage from or to any\\npoint in the restricted area without refer-\\nence to the base point.\\n\\nTACKING: Operation by a carrier be-\\ntween two or more of its regular routes or\\nbetween irregular and regular routes in or-\\nder to reach a point which could not legal-\\nly be served by operation over any single\\nirregular or regular route or combination\\nof regular routes. It is the joinder of sep-\\narate grants of authority at a point com-\\nmon to both,\\n\\nPOINTS: Those locations a carrier is\\nauthorized to carry goods to or from,\\n\\nAUTHORITY: The grant of rights to\\ncarry goods between points or within a re-\\nstricted area.\\n\\nThe facts: During 1969 A-OK began\\nexperiencing severe financial difficulty\\n\\n\\n213\\n\\nwith a resultant decline in the quality of\\nservice. On 17 November 1970, A-OK was\\ndeclared bankrupt. The Trustee In Bank-\\nruptcy did not continue A-OK’s operations\\nas a carrier. After marshalling the assets\\nof A-OK, the Trustee determined that its\\nmost valuable asset was the certificate of\\nauthority for regular and irregular intra-\\nstate routes in Alabama. The Trustee in-\\nvited bids from interested carriers to pur-\\nchase A-OK’s certificate. The Trustee se-\\nlected a group of the highest bidders and\\nentered into further negotiations with them.\\nThe result of these negotiations were sepa-\\nrate contracts with the four applicants to\\npurchase the rights of A-OK under its cer-\\ntificate as described before. The contracts\\nwere conditioned upon APSC approval of\\nthe sale.\\n\\nThe pertinent portion of the APSC’s or-\\nder which denied approval is as follows:\\n\\n“A-OK ceased operations contemporane-\\nously with its bankruptcy and, while he\\nmay have had the authority to continue or\\nre-open operations under the A-OK certif-\\nicate, the Trustee in Bankruptcy did not do\\nso. Thus, at the time of the hearing, there\\nhad been no service rendered under the\\nA-OK authority in over 16 months and it\\nis now almost two years that the rights\\nsought to be transferred have been inac-\\ntive. There was also evidence to the ef-\\nfect that from 1969 to actual bankruptcy\\nthat the operations of A-OK were declin-\\ning and at times were sporadic.\\n\\n“While the applicants sponsored several\\nshipper witnesses, it is abundantly clear\\nfrom the record before us, and we find as\\na fact that during this extended hiatus in\\noperations, the protestants have successful-\\nly filled the void created by the demise of\\nA-OK. For example, the protestant Hor-\\nnady Brothers, subsequent to the A-OK\\nbankruptcy, came before, this Commission\\nseeking to obtain authority to operate be-\\ntween several points formerly served by\\nA-OK. That application was not opposed\\nby the Trustee in Bankruptcy for A-OK,\\nand the evidence presented to this Commis-\\n\\nsion in that proceeding showed that the\\npublic convenience and necessity required\\nthe granting of the authority sought by\\nprotestant Hornady (see Certificate No.\\n647). If these sales and transfers are ap-\\nproved as sought, from the evidence it ap-\\npears that the protestant Hornady Brothers\\ncould be put out of business. As another\\nexample, we note that one of the witnesses\\noffered by the applicants, Roy Nelson,\\nPresident of Towns Express, testified that\\nhis small cartage operation would be de-\\nstroyed by the introduction of the applicant\\nGordons into the area which he services\\nwhereas he could compete successfully with\\nA-OK. Not only has the void been filled,\\nit is crystal clear, and we find as a fact,\\nthat the various protestants are rendering\\nprompt, efficient service to that portion of\\nthe shipping public formerly served by A-\\nOK. The record further establishes that\\nthe quality of service now being rendered\\nin the areas formerly served by A-OK is\\nbetter than that provided by A-OK in the\\nlast year of its existence. While several\\nof the witnesses sponsored by the appli-\\ncants indicated that they would like to\\nhave an additional carrier available to\\nthem, none of them were without reason-\\nable service. Thus, if this were a case of\\ndetermining whether to initially grant a\\nnew authority there would be no question\\nbut that it should be denied. We are, how-\\never, dealing with a transfer case governed\\nby Section 301(15) and our determination\\ntherefore must be on the basis of whether\\nthe transfer is ‘consistent with the public\\ninterest.’\\n\\n“Tt can be argued that we could, on the\\nbasis of substantial authorities, find that\\nthese rights are dormant and not available\\nfor transfer in any event. We are mindful\\nof the large number of creditors who\\nwould be adversely affected by such a rul-\\ning. If these rights are again offered for\\nsale in a form consistent with the spirit of\\nthis order and the public interest, and if\\nsuch sales are approved by this Commis-\\nsion, a substantial sum would thereby be\\nrealized by the creditors of A-OK from\\n\\n\\n214\\n\\nsuch sale. A number of the major protes-\\ntants stated, on the record, that they would\\nnot object to the transfer of all of the A-\\nOK authorities to one purchaser, or to the\\ntransfer of the A-OK irregular route au-\\nthorities to one transferee and its regular\\nroute authorities to another. It is to be\\nnoted that the Trustee in Bankruptcy testi-\\nfied that the authorities sought to be trans-\\nferred could be transferred as suggested by\\nsome of the protestants at a minimal dif-\\nferential to the creditors. While we are\\nneither unmindful nor unsympathetic with\\nthe expressed interest of the Trustee to\\nmaximize the return to the creditors, we\\nare, in this proceeding, charged with the\\nduty of protecting the interests of the pub-\\nlic, including the continuing shipping needs\\nof these creditors, the carriers now serving\\nthem and the public at large.\\n\\n“There are a number of reasons why we\\nfind the proposed transfers would not be\\nconsistent with the public interest, but\\nchief among them is the fact that the\\ntransfers as proposed, if approved, would\\nresult in four distinct new operations re-\\nplacing one arguably dormant operation\\nwith the injection of four vigorously com-\\npetitive carriers into markets adequately\\nserved by protestants,\\n\\n“The record establishes, and we so find,\\nthat when the proposed division of this au-\\nthority is considered in conjunction with\\nthe authorities presently held by the appli-\\ncants, and the tacking that would be possi-\\nble, we are not being asked to approve the\\nrevival of the A-OK’s rights but to ap-\\nprove a major readjustment of the trans-\\nportation industry of Alabama. Based on\\nthe record before us, we find that the ap-\\nplicants have failed to establish that it is in\\nthe public interest to approve the transfers\\nas proposed. These applications have been\\npresented as a ‘package’ and as we under-\\nstand the applications, we must approve or\\ndisapprove of the transfers as a group.\\n\\n“The record is clear, and we find that\\nthe granting of the applications would tend\\n\\nto seriously impair the ability of the car-\\ntiers presently serving the former A-OK\\nareas to continue to render satisfactory\\nservice. -The exhibits and testimony of-\\nfered by protestants, and the testimony\\nelicited on cross-examination of some car-\\nrier witnesses discloses that while the in-\\ntrastate traffic here involved is not the\\nprimary concern to the applicants the prob-\\nably (sic) diversion of a portion of that\\ntraffic would be detrimental to the protes-\\ntants and in turn the public interest in a\\nsound transportation system. This is not\\nto say that we would deny or approve the\\ntransfer of these rights in toto to a single\\napplicant, but that case is not before us.\\nTaking into consideration the full import\\nof splitting this certificate into four certif-\\nicates and the duplication of authorities\\nand points that would result from the\\ngranting of the transfers as proposed, we\\nare compelled to find that the applications\\nare due to be denied as not being consist-\\nent with the public interest.”\\n\\nThe issues for decision are: (1) Were\\nthe applications a “package deal” which\\nAPSC had to accept or reject in its entire-\\nty? (2) Were the findings of fact in the\\norder of APSC contrary to the substantial\\nweight of the evidence, or did APSC err\\nto the prejudice of the applicants’ substan-\\ntial rights in its application of law to the\\nfacts.\\n\\nTHM Before turning to the issues, we\\nnote that our standards for review of an\\norder of the APSC are well settled. See\\nState v. Alabama Public Service Commis-\\nsion, 293 Ala. 533, 307 So.2d 521 (1975),\\nand cases cited therein. Succintly stated,\\nthose standards are: an order of APSC is\\nreviewed with a presumption that it is pri-\\nma facie just and reasonable; will not be\\noverturned unless based upon\\n\\nfindings of fact contrary to the substan-\\ntial weight of the evidence, or unless it\\nis shown that APSC erred to the preji\\ndice of the contesting parties substantial\\nrights in its application of the law to the\\nfacts. .\\n\\n\\nPresumptions are indulged in favor of the\\norders of APSC because the legislature has\\ncommitted to APSC matters of vast public\\ninterest requiring its special administrative\\nexpertise. See Fraternal Order of Police,\\nStrawberry Lodge # 40 v. Entrekin, 294\\nAla. 201, 314 So.2d 663 (1975). Therefore\\nwe review the Commission’s order as\\nthough it had been appealed directly to\\nthis court, and do not review the judgment\\nof the Circuit Court with any presumption\\nof correctness. Alabama Gas Corporation\\nv, Wallace, 293 Ala. 594, 308 So.2d 674\\n(1975). We are fully committed to the\\npropositions that the courts of this State\\nmust not substitute their own judgments or\\nfindings of fact for the judgment of the\\nCommission.\\n\\nIssue (1): A “Package Deal?”\\n\\nHI The Commission found that the ap-\\nplications were presented as a “package”\\nwhich it had to either approve or disap-\\nprove in its entirety.\\n\\nThe contentions of the various parties to\\nthis litigation are found in six briefs and\\nthree appendices to one of those briefs,\\ncontaining an aggregate of three hundred\\npages, Much-of the argument of each of\\nthe parties’ litigant is misdirected from the\\nkey issue which, simply stated, is: was\\nthere “substantial” evidence when consid-\\nered most favorable to upholding the Or-\\nder of APSC tends to support the action\\nof APSC reflected in that Order?\\n\\nAll applicants contend the Commission\\nshould have considered each of their appli-\\ncations separately. Applicants point out\\nthat each sought approval to purchase\\nparts of the rights under the Certificate Of\\nAuthority of A-OK based on a separate\\ncontract made with the Trustee In Bank-\\nruptcy. Applicants also note that each ap-\\nplication was treated separately although\\nconsolidated for hearing,\\n\\nIn separate brief applicant Mason and\\nDixon contends the Commission should\\n\\n215\\n\\nhave given completely separate considera-\\ntion to its application and approved same\\nbecause: (1) Mason and Dixon sought to\\npurchase all of A~OK’s regular route au-\\nthority, (2) The Commission order ex-\\npressly stated it would approve transfer of\\nthe regular route authority to one carrier,\\n(3) Protestants admitted they would not\\nprotest transfer of the regular route au-\\nthority to one carrier.\\n\\nThe Order of the Commission is sup-\\nported by substantial evidence in the rec-\\nord. The record has been carefully exam-\\nined, It consists of 2,109 pages, in 12 vol-\\numes, having a weight of 59 pounds avoir-\\ndupois. It shows the four separate con-\\ntracts were the result of a single negotia-\\ntion with the Trustee In Bankruptcy of\\nA-OK. The Trustee’s testimony indicates\\nthe decision to contract with the four car-\\nriers was arrived at only after he consid-\\nered the total effect of the four contracts\\non the Alabama Transportation Industry.\\nThe record also shows the Trustee entered\\ninto those contracts based on his view that\\nthe agreed division of A-OK’s rights\\nwould be acceptable to APSC. Moreover,\\nwhile the Commission indicated it would\\napprove transfer of the regular route au-\\nthority to one carrier, it did not indicate it\\nwould approve transfer of such authority\\nto Mason and Dixon, There was no preju-\\ndice to Mason and Dixon nor any other\\napplicant. Reversible error cannot be\\npredicated upon the Commission’s judg-\\nment to consider the applications as a\\n“package.”\\n\\nIssue (2): Substantial Weight of the Evi-\\ndence\\n\\nHI Applicants argue the Commission’s\\ndecision finding the proposed transfer of\\nauthority not to be in the public interest is\\nnot supported by the substantial weight of\\nthe evidence. Applicants contend the rec-\\nord shows only that protestants fear new\\ncompetition and possible diversion of intra-\\nstate traffic. This fear, applicants assert,\\nis legally insufficient to support a finding\\n\\n\\n216\\n\\nthat approval of the applications is not in\\nthe public interest. See Alabama Public\\nService Commission v. Chem-Haulers, Inc.,\\n293 Ala. 677, 309 So.2d 453 (1975). Appli-\\ncants further note that although the public\\ninterest test includes consideration of the\\neffect of new competition on existing car-\\nriers, nevertheless the record here conclu-\\nsively demonstrates that any competitive\\neffect that might result from approval of\\nthe applications is so negligible that no\\nprotestant could be harmed.\\n\\nThese arguments take a very narrow\\nview of a multifaceted Commission order.\\nThat order affirmatively shows that disap-\\nproval of the applications was not based\\nsolely on findings of diversion or competi-\\ntive effect. The Commission found that\\napproval of the applications would result in\\na major restructuring of Alabama’s Trans-\\nportation Industry. This finding was\\nbased on considerations of diversion, com-\\npetitive effect, and an implicit factor; di-\\nviding A~-OK’s authority under its certifi-\\ncate in the manner requested would result\\nin applicant carriers being allowed to dra-\\nmatically increase the areas those carriers\\ncould serve directly or indirectly. There is\\nsubstantial evidence in the record of the\\nproceedings before the Commission which\\nsupports the finding that such a restructur-\\ning would occur. The Commission’s order\\nindicates that various factors, including\\ncreditors’ interests, Floyd & Beasley\\nTransfer Co., Inc. v. Alabama Public Serv-\\nice Commission, 276 Ala. 130, 159 So.2d\\n833 (1963), entered into its judgment that\\nthe proposed transfers would not be in the\\npublic interest. On this record we cannot\\nsay the decision of the Commission is not\\nsupported by substantial evidence or that\\nthe Commission erred to the prejudice of\\nthe applicants’ substantial rights when it\\ndecided the proposed transfers would not\\nbe in the public interest.\\n\\nThe judgment of the Circuit Court of\\nCovington County is reversed. We re-\\nmand with directions that an order affirm-\\ning the order of the Alabama Public Serv-\\n\\nice Commission and allowing costs to pro-\\ntestants be entered.\\n\\nReversed and remanded with directions.\\n\\nBLOODWORTH, MADDOX, FAULK-\\nNER and ALMON, JJ., concur.\\n\\n326.

Gordon, Mobile, for appellee.\\n\\nMERRILL, Justice.\\n\\nPlaintiff filed a complaint alleging his\\nwrongful discharge by defendant on March\\n10, 1975. Defendant filed a motion to dis-\\nmiss with prejudice on March 27. The\\nmotion was granted June 17 after argu-\\nment of counsel. A motion to reconsider\\nwas made on June 23, and after oral argu-\\nments, denied on August 1. We affirm.\\n\\nThe only theory for recovery set out in\\nthe complaint was the alleged wrongful\\ndischarge from employment. Attached to\\nand made a part of the complaint was a la-\\nbor agreement between plaintiff’s national\\nlabor union and defendant, a company en-\\ngaged in interstate commerce. The labor\\nagreement provides for binding arbitration\\non the question of discharge.\\n\\nThe primary ground of relief sought in\\nthe complaint is specific performance, and\\nincidental relief by way of damages is\\nclaimed. The trial court gave no written\\nreason for granting the motion to dismiss,\\nbut plaintiff argues that it was because the\\nsingle ground of defendant’s motion was\\nthat the complaint “*¥ * * fails to state\\na claim upon which relief can be granted\\nin that the laws of this state do not permit\\nthe maintenance of an action for specific\\nperformance of a contract of employment.”\\n\\nTitle 9, § 55, Code 1940, lists certain\\ntypes of obligations that cannot be strictly\\nenforced, and among them are, “An obliga-\\ntion to render personal service” and “An\\nobligation to employ another in personal\\nservice.”\\n\\nPlaintiff apparently concedes in brief\\nthat specific performance would not lie but\\n\\n\\n218\\n\\nhe contends ARCP “require that the Court\\nlook beyond the demand for relief on the\\nsurface of the’ Complaint to determine the\\nappropriate relief the litigant may be enti-\\ntled to.” .\\n\\nHere, the only other relief would be\\ndamages for the alleged wrongful dis-\\ncharge.\\n\\nAt one time (1963), this court\\nheld that it had the right to determine the\\ndamages for a wrongful discharge from\\nemployment in a case similar to this one\\nnow before us. It was so held in Republic\\nSteel Corp. v. Maddox, 275 Ala. 685, 158\\nSo.2d 492, But that decision was reversed\\nin 379 U.S. 650, 85 S.Ct. 614, 13 L.Ed.2d\\n580. We understand the holding of the\\nFederal Supreme Court to be that general-\\nly: (1) state law is pre-empted by federal\\nlabor law; (2) the employee must attempt\\nto implement the grievance procedure pro-\\nvided in the labor agreement; (3) the\\ngrievance procedures must be exhausted,\\nand (4) the grievance procedure in the\\nagreement provides the claimant an exclu-\\nsive means of redress.\\n\\nTM This is the compelling reason why\\nwe must hold that plaintiff\\'s suit was prop-\\nerly dismissed.\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

We\\naffirm.\\n\\nThe case arose out of an automobile ac-\\ncident which occurred on a public road in\\nBirmingham, Alabama, September 4, 1971.\\nPlaintiff Pinson avers in his complaint\\nthat defendant Haddock, while acting with-\\nin the line and scope of his employment\\nwith defendant West Bend, so negligently\\noperated his motor vehicle as to cause it to\\ncollide with a vehicle being driven by Pin-\\nson, in which Pinson’s wife was a passen-\\nger, and that, as a proximate consequence,\\nPinson’s wife was killed; and, Pinson\\nclaims damages therefor.\\n\\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of\\ndefendants Haddock and West Bend.\\n\\nJudgment was entered thereon, Plaintiff\\nPinson filed a motion for new trial based\\n\\non the ground that the verdict was against\\nthe preponderance of the evidence. The\\nmotion was overruled by the trial court.\\n\\nPinson’s appeal is based on the grounds\\nthat the great preponderance of the evi-\\ndence establishes that the injuries sustained\\nby Mrs. Pinson in the automobile collision\\nproximately contributed to her subsequent\\ndeath.\\n\\nThe facts are that on Saturday, the day\\nof the collision, Mrs. Pinson was not\\naware of having sustained any injuries.\\nHowever, on Sunday she began experienc-\\ning some pain in her chest, neck, and\\nshoulders, and by Monday had taken to\\nbed. She first visited a physician on Tues-\\nday and made a return visit on Friday.\\nOn Saturday, one week from the date of\\nthe collision, she was hospitalized and was\\nplaced in traction. Shortly after her ad-\\n\\nmission, she developed a cardiac “dysrhyth-\\nmia” [abnormal or irregular rhythm] in\\nher heartbeat. On October 4, after three\\nand a half weeks in the hospital, Mrs, Pin-\\nson died.\\n\\nThe death certificate signed by the at-\\ntending physician Dr. Patton and dated\\nOctober 23, 1971, listed the immediate\\ncause of death as “Ischemia heart disease\\ndue to arteriosclerosis” [a condition -in-\\nvolving a lack of blood supply to the\\nheart].\\n\\nPlaintiff Pinson’s expert witness, Dr.\\nCasten, concluded that the precipitating\\ncause of the deceased’s death was the\\nwhiplash injury she sustained in the auto-\\nmobile collision “[b]ecause we -have no\\nother precipitating event that’s presented to\\nus.” This witness testified that the de-\\nceased’s emotional stress over her hospital-\\nization and necessary separation from her\\nchildren, along with the physical stress of\\nconfinement in traction, resulted in the im-\\nposition of additional strain on the de-\\nceased’s heart which was already doing ex-\\n\\ntra work because of deceased’s coronary.\\n\\nblockage. In view of the fact that the de-\\nceased had never experienced back or neck\\npains prior to the accident, the testimony\\nof plaintiff Pinson’s expert witness is said\\nto have established by a preponderance of\\nthe evidence that deceased’s death was the\\nproximate result of the accident.\\n\\nPlaintiff Pinson further contends that\\nnegligence is also established by a prepon-\\nderance of the evidence. This contention\\nis based on the claim that Pinson’s station-\\nary vehicle was struck in its rear by de-\\nfendant Haddock’s vehicle. Pinson and\\nHaddock were both in a line of traffic\\nwhich was stopped at a traffic light.\\nWhen the light changed to green, the lead\\nvehicle in the line (a wrecker), pulled into\\nthe intersection and promptly stalled. The\\ncar immediately behind the wrecker\\nstopped. Pinson’s vehicle was next in line;\\nPinson testified that he did not move his\\nvehicle from its stationary position. Had-\\n\\n221\\n\\ndock’s testimony is that Pinson’s vehicle\\nhad started to move forward. Defendant\\nHaddock, whose vehicle was stopped imme-\\ndiately behind Pinson’s, began moving his\\nvehicle when, Haddock claims, Pinson\\nstopped suddenly, thereby causing a colli-\\nsion with Pinson’s vehicle. Pinson’s vehi-\\ncle was pushed into the rear of the vehicle\\nstopped in front of it and was damaged\\nboth in the front and in the rear, Pinson\\nargues that the mere fact that defendant\\nhit Pinson’s stationary vehicle from the\\nrear is uncontrovertible proof of defend-\\nant’s negligence.\\n\\nThe plaintiff\\'s contention on this appeal\\nis that the trial court erred in not granting\\na new trial on the ground that the verdict\\nof the jury is contrary to the evidence.\\nHe contends that the great preponderance\\nof the evidence against the verdict is so\\ndecided as to clearly convince the court\\nthat it was wrong and unjust, He cites\\nCobb v, Malone et al., 92 Ala. 630, 9 So,\\n738 (1890), inter alia.\\n\\nWe cannot agree with this contention\\nand must conclude that there is not a pre-\\nponderance of the evidence in plaintiff\\'s\\nfavor either on the issue of negligence or\\nproximate cause,\\n\\nOur rules of review are well settled.\\n\\nTI Verdicts are presumed correct and\\nno ground of new trial is more carefully\\nscrutinized than that the verdict is against\\nthe weight of the evidence. Taylor v.\\nThompson, 271 Ala. 18, 122 So2d 277\\n(1960).\\n\\nHI The correctness of a jury’s verdict\\nis strengthened when the trial judge refus-\\nes to grant a new trial, Smith v. Cullen,\\n270 Ala. 92, 116 So.2d 582 (1959).\\n\\nHE On the issue of negligence, defend-\\nant-Haddock was only required to use that\\ndegree of care required by a reasonable\\nand prudent man. The jury could reasona-\\nbly have found that Haddock did not have\\n\\n\\n222\\n\\nsufficient time to stop his vehicle, being\\nconfronted with the sudden stopping of\\nPinson’s vehicle.\\n\\nHI On the issue of proximate cause,\\nthe evidence reasonably supports the theo-\\nry that Mrs. Pinson’s health was already\\npoor prior to the accident. There is some\\nevidence in the record to the effect that\\nthe advanced case of arteriosclerosis from\\nwhich Mrs. Pinson suffered was sufficient\\nto have caused her death even without the\\nadditional strain caused by the whiplash in-\\njury. At any rate, the question of initial\\nnegligence as well as the causal relation-\\nship between the accident and Mrs. Pin-\\nson’s death, were both matters for determi-\\nnation by the jury. There is not such a\\npreponderance of the evidence against the\\nverdict so as to clearly convince us that it\\nwas wrong and unjust.\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\nHEBLIN, C.

The interest\\nclaimed by Alabama Mineral Land Compa-\\nny was acquired by R. Hugh Daniel, Jr.\\nand Charles W. Daniel in August of 1972.\\nThey, too, became intervenors.\\n\\nAfter hearing the evidence, the trial\\njudge entered a decree finding the 1968\\ndeed valid and that title to the 35 acres\\nwas in the Daniels, From this judgment\\nthe Macons appealed.\\n\\nRecord title to the property has been in\\nAlabama Mineral Land Company and its\\npredecessors in title for many decades.\\nAlabama Mineral Land Company has paid\\ntaxes on the property for many years, The\\nBrashers have lived on the property since\\n1935; and, in 1951, assessed the property\\nin their names and paid back taxes on the\\nproperty for the years 1947 to 1951, and\\ncontinued to pay the taxes through 1971.\\n\\n\\n224\\n\\nIt was the contention of Alabama Miner-\\nal Land Company, which owned several\\nthousand acres of land, of which this 40\\nacres was a part, that Mr. and Mrs. Brash-\\ner had lived on the property with the per-\\nmission of the owner. In 1968, Mr. and\\nMrs. Brasher executed a deed to Alabama\\nMineral Land Company for 35 of these\\nacres; and the company executed a deed\\nto them conveying five acres off of one\\nside of the 40-acre tract on which the\\nBrashers had built a house many years be-\\nfore.\\n\\nIf the evidence supports the trial court’s\\nfinding that the deed from the Brashers to\\n\\nAlabama Mineral Land Company of the 35.\\n\\nacres was valid, there is no necessity to\\ntreat the question of whether the Brashers\\nhad acquired title to the property by ad-\\nverse possession.\\n\\nMr. Karl Harrison, an attorney who rep-\\nresented Alabama Mineral Land Company\\nat the time of the exchange of deeds be-\\ntween Alabama Mineral Land Company\\nand the Brashers, testified that an agent and\\nemployee of the company explained to him\\nthat there had been some problem with the\\nBrashers which came to light when the\\ncompany discovered that the Brashers had\\nbeen paying taxes on the property. This\\nagent worked out an agreement with the\\nBrashers whereby it was agreed that the\\nBrashers would convey 35 acres of the\\n40 to Alabama Land Mineral Company\\nin exchange for a refund of the taxes\\nthey ‘had paid on the 40 acres; and\\nfurther, in exchange for a warranty deed\\nconveying to them five acres of the land\\nupon which their house was situated. Mr.\\nHarrison prepared the deeds and went with\\nAlabama Mineral’s agent to the Brashers\\nand explained what the documents were.\\nThe deed to them conveying the five acres\\nwas delivered by Mr, Harrison. The\\nBrashers executed the deed to Alabama\\nMineral Land Company and were given a\\ncheck drawn by Alabama Mineral to them\\nreimbursing the amount of taxes paid by\\nthe Brashers. .\\n\\nThe Macons, successors in title to the in-\\nterest claimed by the Brashers, contend\\nthat the deed conveying the 35 acres signed\\nby the Brashers was not based upon consid-\\neration and was procured by fraud. Mrs.\\nBrasher testified that she did not remem-\\nber signing the deed. Neither she nor Mr.\\nBrasher could write, and the deed was exe-\\ncuted by them by mark, Mr. Harrison tes-\\ntified that it was signed in his presence\\nafter he explained to them what the deed\\nwas and what the entire transaction meant.\\nHis testimony was that both of them knew\\nwhat was involved, they appeared to be in\\ngood health, and appeared to understand\\nand agreed to this transaction. It was his\\ntestimony that he told Mr. and Mrs. Brash-\\ner that they did not have a deed to the\\nland; that it was Alabama Mineral’s con-\\ntention that they were occupying the land\\npermissively, but that Alabama Mineral\\nwas willing to reimburse the taxes they\\nhad paid (some $120.00) and, in addition,\\nconvey to them five acres of the land upon\\nwhich their house was situated.\\n\\nAlthough Mrs. Brasher testified that she\\nhad no recollection of signing the deed and\\ndid not identify her mark, her daughter-\\nin-law testified that she learned from Mrs.\\nBrasher that the transaction had taken\\nplace. Mr. Brasher was dead when the\\nhearing was had and, hence, was unable to\\ntestify. :\\n\\nMr. Oden, Chairman of the Board of Al-\\nabama Land Mineral Company, testified\\nthat Mr. Brasher had worked for a prede-\\ncessor corporation which had owned the\\nland in question before it was acquired by\\nhis company; that his father and an-\\nother man owned this land through this\\ncorporation; and that Mr. Brasher had\\nworked for that corporation. During the\\ndepression, he had no place to live and was\\ngiven permission to build the house on the\\nland. There was testimony that, when the\\ncompany was cutting logs in the area, they\\nleft enough logs for Mr. Brasher to build\\nhis house. He, his wife and son lived on\\nthe property from 1935 until shortly before\\n\\n\\n225\\n\\nthis suit was filed. When it was discov-\\nered that the Brashers had been paying\\ntaxes on it, the company worked out an\\nagreement with the Brashers to repay them\\nthe taxes they had paid and, in addition,\\ndeed them 5 acres. The Brashers agreed\\nto this arrangement and signed the deed to\\nthe company conveying the 35 acres and\\nwere given a warranty deed by the compa-\\nny to the five acres. The taxes were reim-\\nbursed and the Brashers cashed the check.\\n\\nMrs, Brasher, on one of the hearings in\\n- this case, testified that she and her hus-\\nband were given permission to build their\\nhouse on this property; but, at a different\\nhearing, she testified that she did not re-\\nmember signing any deed to the 35 acres,\\nShe testified that she remembered Mr.\\nHarrison and an agent of Alabama Miner-\\nal coming to their house and talking about\\nthe Brashers making a deed to the compa-\\nny to 35 acres, and the company would\\nmake a deed to them of five acres. She\\nremembered that her husband was told that\\nthe company would reimburse them for the\\ntaxes they had paid on the property. She\\nremembered that the company did repay\\nthem for the taxes. She also remembered\\nthat Mr. Harrison and the agent of the\\ncompany came to their house and had a\\ndeed for them to sign. She said that her\\nhusband handled the transaction, but she\\nremembered it. She testified that she did\\nnot remember whether or not she signed\\nthe deed.\\n\\nMrs, Brasher did say that her husband\\ntold her that if they ever decided to sell\\nthe 5 acres that they should give Mr. Oden\\nthe first chance to buy it, because he had\\nbeen so nice to them. She also said that\\nwhen she decided to sell it after her hus-\\nband’s death that she did call Mr. Oden\\nand offer him the first chance to buy the 5\\nacres,\\n\\nIt was uncontradicted that the deed from\\nAlabama Mineral to the Brashers convey-\\ning the 5 acres was delivered simultaneous-\\nly with the deed from them conveying to\\nAlabama Mineral the 35 acres. No claim\\n\\nis made that the deed from Alabama Min-\\neral is defective for failure of considera-\\ntion. Yet, all it got in exchange for the\\ndeed was the exchange deed from the\\nBrashers.\\n\\nHM As we read the evidence in this\\ncase, we are in agreement with the trial\\ncourt that the Brashers and Macons have,\\nfailed in their burden to prove that the\\ndeed conveying 35 acres to Alabama Min-\\neral Land Company was procured by fraud\\nor was not based upon consideration. Nor\\ndo we find any evidence to support the\\ncharge that Mr. and Mrs, Brasher were\\nnot aware of what they were doing when\\nthey signed the deed.\\n\\nThere is abundant evidence to\\nsupport the trial court’s finding that the\\ndeed was valid and that the Macons failed\\nto prove that it was procured by fraud.\\nOrdinarily, fraud is never presumed and\\nthe burden is on the party asserting fraud\\nto prove it. Morrison v. Federal Land\\nBank of New Orleans, 232 Ala. 138, 167\\nSo. 288 (1936).

In fact, after reading\\nthe record, we are struck with the dearth\\nof evidence to the contrary. We agree\\nwith the result reached by the trial judge\\non this issue; and there being sufficient\\nevidence to support his finding, it will not\\nbe disturbed here. See cases collated at\\n2A Ala.Dig., Appeal and Error, €1008~-\\n1(6).\\n\\nSince we are in agreement with the trial\\ncourt that the evidence fails to support the\\nclaim made by appellants that the deed\\nshould be set aside, we see nothing to be\\n\\n\\n226\\n\\ngained by going into all of the evidence on\\nthe claim of title by adverse possession,\\nEven if the evidence support the appel-\\nlants’ claim that the Brashers had acquired\\ntitle to this property by adverse possession,\\nand we do not concede that it does, rather\\nthere was abundant evidence to indicate\\nthat their possession was permissive the\\nentire period, the fact that they deeded\\ntheir interest in the property to Alabama\\nMineral in 1968 by a valid deed vitiates\\nany necessity to prolong this opinion by\\ngoing into the evidence pro and con on the\\nissue of adverse possession.\\n\\nFinding the judgment of the trial court\\nfully supported by the evidence, the same\\nis affirmed,\\n\\nAffirmed,\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

From this ruling the\\nplaintiff appeals.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1969, Mr. Willie Lee Bal-\\nlard, an independent trucker, was making a\\ndelivery to Home Farm Supply Company\\nin Troy, Alabama. While his truck was\\nbeing unloaded, Mr. Ballard asked Mr.\\nJames L. Smith if he could borrow a pick-\\nup truck for the purpose of going to an-\\nother city to acquire a replacement part\\nfor his truck. The record reveals a con-\\nflict in testimony as to what city Mr. Bal-\\nlard said was his destination, but Mr.\\n\\nSmith gave him permission to use the\\ntruck. While using the truck, Mr. Ballard\\nwas involved in an accident in which the\\nappellant’s minor son was killed. On April\\n3, 1973, a default judgment was rendered\\nagainst Ballard.\\n\\nMr. Smith is a partner in Home Farm\\nSupply Company and manager for the\\npartnership. The pick-up truck in question\\nis owned by another partner, Mr. H. F.\\nMcCroskey. Under an arrangement be-\\ntween Mr. McCroskey and the partnership,\\nthe partnership used the truck in exchange\\nfor paying the operational expenses—main-\\ntenance, gasoline, oil, and insurance. Mr.\\nH. F. McCroskey was the named insured.\\n\\nThe policy contains the following defini-\\ntion:\\n\\n“Insured—under Coverages A, B, C,\\nand C-l, the unqualified word ‘insured’\\nincludes (1) the named insured, and also\\nincludes (2) his relatives, (3) any other\\nperson while using the automobile, pro-\\nvided the actual use of the automobile is\\nwith the express permission of the\\nnamed insured, and (4) under Coverages\\nA and B any person or organization le-\\ngally responsible for the use thereof by\\nan insured as defined under the three\\nsubsections above.” (Emphasis added)\\n\\nAppellant contends that every general\\npartner is an agent for the partnership in\\ntransacting business and therefore Mr,\\nSmith was authorized to permit Mr. Bal-\\nJard to use the truck; that Mr. Smith had\\na least ostensible or apparent authority to\\n\\n‘allow Mr. Ballard to use the truck; and\\n\\nthat the policy should be reformed with re-\\ngard to “named insured” to conform to the\\nreal agreement of the parties.\\n\\nAlabama Farm Bureau contends that the\\ncase of Alabama Farm Bureau Mutual\\nCasualty Ins. Co. v. Government Em-\\nployees Ins. Co., 286 Ala. 414, 240 So.2d\\n664 (1970), is controlling as it involved an\\nidentical policy.\\n\\n= 228\\n\\nHo The appellant correctly contends\\nthat “permission” as used in an omnibus\\nclause may be express or implied and that\\nimplied permission may be inferred from\\nthe facts and circumstances of the case,\\nHarrison v. Densmore, 279 Ala. 190, 183\\nSo.2d 787 (1966). But more than just\\n“permission” is required by the clause in\\nthe instant policy—“express permission” is\\nnecessary. In Alabama Farm Bureau Mu-\\ntual Casualty Ins. Co. v. Government Em-\\nployees Ins, Co., supra, this court had be-\\nfore it the identical clause. There, the\\ndaughter of the named insured gave her\\npermission to the driver to operate the au-\\ntomobile. On finding no coverage, this\\ncourt said:\\n\\n“The words, ‘express permission,’ are\\nclear and unambiguous. The burden was\\non the driver to establish that he was\\ndriving with ‘express permission’ of the\\nnamed insured. The driver failed to\\ncarry that burden and is not entitled to\\nhave Farm Bureau defend him or pay\\nany judgment which may be recovered\\nagainst him . .” (286 Ala. at 420,\\n240 So.2d at 670)\\n\\nHI Our cases have been consistent in\\nmaking a distinction between policy provi-\\nsions which require the “permission” of the\\ninsured and those which require the “ex-\\npress permission” of the named insured.\\nIn Royal Indemnity Company v.

In construing its statute on re-\\nstraint of a trade or profession, which in-\\ncidentally is identical to our own, the Cali-\\nfornia Court said:\\n\\n“It will be observed that defendant\\nAugustine’s covenant with respect to liq-\\nuidated damages is not expressly cast in\\nnegative form, and because of this it is\\ninsisted by appellant that it is not a con-\\ntract restraining Augustine from exercis-\\ning a lawful business, but is merely an\\nagreement that if he did engage in such\\nbusiness he would pay the sum of $5,000\\n[five thousand dollars] as liquidated\\ndamages, and that the contract does not,\\ntherefore, violate the Code’ provision. In\\n\\n232\\n\\nform, the agreement is as appellant\\nclaims. But none the less it is a contract\\nwhich operates to restrain Augustine\\nfrom carrying on the business mentioned.\\nIt imposes upon him a liability in the\\nsum of $5,000 [five thousand dollars] if\\nhe does engage in such business, If the\\ncontract is valid, he is not as free to do\\nso as he would have been if he were not\\nbound by it. To the extent that the ne-\\ncessity of paying $5,000 [five thousand\\ndoilars] deters him from engaging there-\\nin, he would be restrained. This is\\nclearly a restraint of a substantial char-\\nacter and the form in which it is cast\\ndoes not make it less a restraint. . .\\nThe covenant in question clearly oper-\\nates to restrain the defendant from ‘ex-\\nercising a lawful profession, trade, or\\nbusiness’ [the language of the California\\nand Alabama statutes] and as it does not\\nfall within the exceptions given in sec-\\ntion 1673, it is, therefore, void.” (172\\nCal. at 288, 156 P. at 480)\\n\\nWe find the reasoning of the California\\nCourt compelling. In the instant case, too,\\nthe language of the contract has been\\nframed in positive -rather than negative\\nterms. However this appears to us to be a\\nmatter of form rather than substance; the\\npurpose of the provision is to penalize the\\ndefendant if he terminates his employment\\nwith the plaintiff and engages in the prac-\\ntice of medicine in Tallapoosa County\\nwithin twelve months thereafter. In ef-\\nfect, it requires him to forfeit $20,000 in\\norder to pursue the practice of medicine in\\nthat county within that period of time. It\\nis a restraint on the exercise of a lawful\\nprofession in violation of Title 9, § 22, su-\\npra, and is therefore void.\\n\\nThe judgment appealed from is af\\nfirmed,\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Street, as ad-\\nministrator of the estate of Sam W. Street,\\ndeceased, brought this action against appel-\\nlees, Mr. and Mrs, W. O. Hilburn, for the\\nreturn of certain monies which were with-\\ndrawn by Mrs. Hilburn from joint bank\\naccounts with right of survivorship with\\nthe deceased. The withdrawals occurred\\nafter the death of Sam W. Street.\\n\\nThe deceased lived in the home of the\\nappellees from February, 1971, until he died\\nintestate on October 15, 1974.° He was\\nsurvived by a son and daughter; his wife,\\nMary C. Street, having died in May, 1971.\\n\\nPrior to 1971 the deceased maintained\\nthree bank accounts at Birmingham Fed-\\neral Savings and Loan Association. Two\\nof these accounts were in the joint names\\nof the deceased and his wife. The other\\nwas in the name of the deceased, his wife,\\nand appellee, Mrs. Hilburn.\\n\\nThese three accounts were, during 1970\\nand 1971, transferred to three new accounts\\nat Birmingham Federal Savings and Loan\\nAssociation as follows:\\n\\n1. The deceased on May 20, 1970, open-\\ned account No, SHC-488 with an initial de-\\nposit of $16,000.00. This account was in\\nthe joint names of the deceased, his wife,\\nand Mrs. Hilburn.\\n\\n2. The deceased on or about July 12,\\n1971, opened account No. 28033. This ac-\\ncount was in the joint names of the deceas-\\ned and Mrs. Hilburn,\\n\\n3. The deceased, on or about July 27,\\n1971, opened account No, 4-1236. This\\naccount was in the joint names of the de-\\nceased and Mrs. Hilburn.\\n\\nAll the money deposited belonged to the\\ndeceased. Approximately three days after\\nhis death, Mrs. Hilburn withdrew all the\\nmoney from the three accounts listed above,\\na total of $31,053.68.\\n\\n\\n234\\n\\nThe complaint alleged that the appellees\\nhad by diverse methods wrongfully obtain-\\ned the funds from the estate. The trial\\ncourt, after hearing evidence without a\\njury, awarded the monies in dispute to the\\nappellees. .\\n\\nAppellant argues that the deceased never\\nintended to make a gift of any of the\\nmonies in question. He asserts that the law\\nof gifts is here applicable, that the elements\\nof an inter vivos gift were not shown, and\\nthat the monies properly belong to the\\nestate of the deceased.\\n\\nAppellant relies very heavily on First\\nNational Bank of Birmingham v. Hammel,\\n252 Ala. 624, 42 So.2d 459, where the bank\\nbrought suit against Mr. and Mrs, Hammel\\nto set aside the transfer of a joint savings\\naccount carried in the names of Mr. and\\nMrs. Hammel to the sole account of Mrs.\\nHammel as a fraud on the creditors of Mr.\\nHammel. It is true that the Hammel case\\nwas decided on the law of gifts. But here\\nwe have a different situation in that one of\\nthe parties is deceased and we must con-\\nsider the effect of Tit. 5, § 255(4), Code of\\nAlabama 1940, Recompiled 1958, which\\nreads as follows:\\n\\n“When a deposit has been made, or\\nshall hereafter be made, in any savings\\nand loan association in this state in the\\nnames of two persons, payable to either\\nof such persons, or payable to the sur-\\nvivor of them, the said deposit shall,\\nupon the death of either of said persons,\\nbecome the property of and be paid in\\naccordance with its terms to the sur-\\nvivor, irrespective of whether or not the\\nfunds deposited where [sic] the property\\nof only one of said persons, and irrespec-\\ntive of whether or not at the time of the\\nmaking of such deposit there was any in-\\ntention on the part of the persons making\\nsuch deposit to vest the other with a pres-\\nent interest therein, and irrespective of\\nwhether or not only one of said persons,\\nduring their joint lives, had the right\\nto withdraw such deposit, and irrespec-\\ntive of whether or not there’ was any de-\\n\\nlivery of any account book or savings\\naccount book by the person making such\\ndeposit to the other of such persons.\\nThis section will also apply where a de-\\nposit is made in the names of more than\\ntwo persons where there is a provision\\nfor survivorship. Nothing in this sec-\\ntion shall be construed to prohibit the\\nperson making such deposits from with-\\ndrawing or collecting the same during his\\nlifetime, nor shall the fact that such per-\\nson had the right to withdraw or collect\\nsaid deposit during his lifetime operate\\nto defeat the rights herein provided for\\nthe person, or persons, surviving such de-\\npositor.”\\n\\nSo far as we have been able to ascertain\\nthis is a case of first impression. This\\nsubject is dealt with in 43 A.L.R.3d 971,\\nparticularly under the following sections:\\n8. Bank protection statutes, 9. Joint ten-\\nancy statutes, and 10. Statutes expressly\\nestablishing presumption of ownership in\\nsurvivor.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of New Hampshire\\nin dealing with a statute similar to our own\\nheld in In re Wezolek Estate, 112 N.H.\\n310, 295 A2d 444 (1972) that:\\n\\n“This statute, and similar ones in\\nother States, have been classified as\\n‘special statutes’ that specifically allow\\nthe donee to take the balance remaining\\nin the account by precluding any investi-\\ngation of the donor’s intent after the\\ndonor’s death, 60 Mich.L.Rev. 972, 990\\n(1962); 41 Calif.L.Rev. 596, 608-12\\n(1953). In other words, such a statute\\nestablishes property rights in the sur-\\nvivor authorizing the payment of the\\nbalance to him without a showing of the\\ndonative intent on the part of the party\\nfurnishing the funds, or delivery of the\\npassbook or access thereto. 26 U.Chi.L.\\nRev. 376, 380-89 (1959). It was intended\\n‘to put at rest the uncertain results at-\\ntendant, on litigation predicated on the\\ntheory of gifts.’ Parenteau v. Gaillar-\\ndetz, 103 N.H. 92, 95, 166 A.2d 112, 114\\n(1960). It has relieved the surviving\\njoint tenant of the burden of establishing\\n\\n\\nee 235\\nae\\n\\na gift inter vivos. Brennan v. Timmins,\\n104 N.H. 384, 389, 187 A.2d 793, 797\\n(1963).”\\n\\nIn Ward v. Marine Nat\\'l Bank, 38 N.J.\\n132, 183 A.2d 60 (1962), the New Jersey\\nSupreme Court observed that:\\n\\n“.., although the statute is couched\\nin terms of a presumption, the true legis-\\nlative intent was to make a new rule of\\nsubstantive law, we reject the attack on\\nthe constitutionality of the latter statute\\nand hold that it represents a valid exer-\\ncise of the legislative power to alter both\\nthe common law requirements of gifts and\\nthe Statute of Wills. Nor are we alone\\nin this view for other states have held\\nsimilar statutes governing these accounts\\nconstitutional. See Hill v. Badeljy, 107\\nCal.App. 598, 290 P. 637 (D.Ct.App.\\n1930); Heiner v. Greenwich Savings\\nBank, 118 Misc. 326, 193 N.Y.S. 291\\n(Sup.Ct.1922). Quite clearly, the statute\\nhere involved gives both parties to the\\naccount a present right of survivorship.”\\n\\nWe conclude that our statute is clear in\\nits meaning and intent that the survivor of\\na joint bank account is entitled to the pro-\\nceeds. The trial judge ruled correctly.\\n\\nThe judgment in this cause is hereby\\naffirmed.\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Co.,\\namici curiae.\\n\\nSHORES, Justice.\\n\\nIn October, 1972, an agent of Old\\nSouthern Life Insurance Company went\\nto the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ocie T.\\nWoodall for the purpose of selling a hospi-\\ntal insurance policy to them. After some\\ndiscussion, they agreed to buy the insurance\\noffered by Old Southern and paid the first\\nquarterly premium at that time. There-\\nafter, on November 1, 1972, the policy was\\nissued covering both Mr. and Mrs, Wood-\\nall.\\n\\nThe policy contained the following limi-\\ntations or exclusions from liability by Old\\nSouthern:\\n\\n“SPECIFIED WAITING PERIODS\\n\\n“Any loss resulting from tuberculosis,\\nany disease or disorder of the heart or\\n\\n\\n239\\n\\ncirculatory system, hernia, cancer, dis-\\nease or disorder of the gall bladder,\\ndisease or disorder of the urinary system\\nshall be covered only if such disease,\\ndisorder, or sickness originates (becomes\\nmanifest by the symptoms usually asso-\\nciated therewith) and begins after the\\neffective date and loss occurs no less\\nthan six (6) months after the effective\\ndate of this policy.”\\n\\nOn the 27th day of May, 1973, Mrs.\\nWoodall became ill and was ordered con-\\nfined by her physician in Cobb Memorial\\nHospital in Phenix City, Alabama, for-\\ntreatment. Mrs. Woodall’s condition was\\ndiagnosed by her physician as pleural ef-\\nfusion; and she received treatment for\\nsaid condition while confined in the said\\nhospital. Mrs. Woodall’s period of con-\\nfinement and treatment for this condition\\nextended from May 27 until June 16, 1973,\\nat which time she was discharged. The\\ncharge for the services rendered by the\\nhospital for the confinement was $1,157.95.\\n\\nSubsequent to Mrs. Woodall’s release\\nfrom the hospital, Mr. Woodall filed a\\nclaim with Old Southern claiming all sums ~\\ndue under the terms of the contract. On\\nJuly 26, 1973, Old Southern denied the\\nclaim of Mr. and Mrs. Woodall and stated\\nthe reason as follows:\\n\\n“‘The policy which you carry with this\\ncompany provides under the LIMITA-\\nTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS that no\\nLiability for certain conditions are\\ncovered unless the cause thereof origi-\\nnates at least six (6) months from the\\neffective date of the policy. Since the\\ncondition that caused your hospital con-\\nfinement is excluded for six (6) months,\\nno liability could be accepted on this\\nclaim.”\\n\\nSubsequently, on the 30th day of June,\\n1973, Mrs. Woodall again became ill and\\nwas confined by her physician a second time\\nin Cobb Memorial Hospital in Phenix City,\\nAlabama, for treatment. Mrs. Woodall’s\\ncondition was diagnosed on this occasion\\n\\nas pneumonia of the left lung; and she\\nwas treated for this condition during her\\nhospital confinement. Her period of con-\\nfinement and treatment on this occasion\\nextended from June 30 until July 10, 1973,\\nat which time she was discharged. The\\ncharge for the services rendered by the\\nhospital for this confinement was $954.25.\\n\\nSubsequent to Mrs. Woodall’s release\\nfrom the hospital on July 10, 1973, Mr.\\nWoodall again filed a claim with Old\\nSouthern claiming all sums due under the\\nterms of the contract for Mrs. Woodall’s\\nJune 30th to July 10th confinement.\\n\\nOn September 11, 1973, Old Southern\\ndenied this claim and stated the reason as\\nfollows:\\n\\n+ +. no liability could be accepted\\non this claim since it is a continuation\\nof her May 27 hospital confinement.\\nThe condition causing this confinement\\nis not covered unless it develops at least\\nsix months after the effective date of\\nthe policy. Since this condition was\\npresent prior to the policy becoming six\\nmonths old, our only alternative is to\\nwithhold liability . 7\\n\\nMrs. Woodall died sometime after the\\nsecond claim was denied. Thereafter, Mr.\\nWoodall filed the lawsuit in this case\\nclaiming damages from Old Southern on\\nthree theories: (1) Fraud and deceit in\\ninducing him to purchase the insurance\\npolicy; (2) false representations in in-\\nducing him to continue the contract in\\nforce and effect; and (3) willfully and\\ncorruptly denying its liability under the\\ncontract.\\n\\nThe case was submitted to the jury on\\nall three claims; and it returned a general\\nverdict in favor of the plaintiff in the\\namount of $45,000. This appeal is from\\nthe judgment rendered on this verdict.\\n\\nHM The first argument advanced by\\nappellant is that if a tort has been com-\\nmitted, the injured party is Mrs. Woodall\\n\\n\\n240\\n\\nand that such cause of action does not\\nsurvive her death. It is not disputed that\\ncauses of action sounding in tort do not\\nsurvive the death of the injured party.\\nTitle 7, § 150, Code of Alabama 1940.\\nHowever, it is conceded in this case that\\nMr. Woodall paid the premiums for the\\ncoverage offered under the policy. He\\nand his wife were coinsured thereunder.\\nThe record affirmatively establishes that\\nMr. Woodall contracted with Old Southern\\nfor coverage on his wife as well as himself.\\nIt was undisputed that he paid the initial\\npremium, and all subsequent premiums.\\nIt was Mr. Woodall who paid premiums\\non the policy after the claims were denied.\\nIn fact, the letters from Old Southern\\ndenying the claims for Mrs. Woodall’s\\nhospital confinement were addressed to\\nMr. Woodall. There is every indication\\nthat the company dealt exclusively with\\nMr. Woodall as if he were the sole con-\\ntracting party. If there was fraud in-\\nvolved on the part of Old Southern, we\\nthink it is clear that Mr. Woodall was a\\nvictim of that fraud,\\n\\nOld Southern contends that no claim\\nupon which relief may be granted sounding\\nin tort has been stated. It argues that at\\nmost Mr, Woodall has an action for breach\\nof contract. We will address our remarks\\non this argument to each claim separately.\\n\\nMBE The first claim asserted, that Old\\nSouthern fraudulently and falsely rep-\\nresented to Mr. Woodall that claims under\\nthe policy would be paid, knowing that such\\nstatements were faise, constitutes, under\\nour cases, a claim upon which relief may\\nbe granted. Undeniably, when one issues\\na policy of insurance, and accepts the pre-\\nmium therefor, there is an implied, if not\\nexpress, promise to perform the act, i. e,\\nhonor valid claims made thereunder. If\\nsuch promise is made with a present intent\\nnot to perform, this amounts to a fraudu-\\nlent misrepresentation. In Walker v.\\nWoodall, 288 Ala. 510, 513, 262 So.2d 756,\\n759 (1972), the following appears:\\n\\n“In order for a promise to constitute\\na fraudulent representation it is neces-\\n\\nsary that it have been made with the in-\\ntent not to perform the act. Birming-\\nham Broadcasting Co. v. Bell, 259 Ala.\\n656, 68 So2d 314; Nelson v. Darling\\nShop of Birmingham, Inc., 275 Ala. 598,\\n157 So.2d 23.\\n\\n“Intent is an act or emotion of the\\nmind seldom, if ever, capable of direct\\nproof, but is determined by such just\\nand reasonable deductions from the acts\\nand facts presented as the guarded judg-\\nment of a reasonably prudent and cau-\\ntious man would draw therefrom.\\nHagerty v. Hagerty, 186 Towa 1329, 172\\nN.W. 259, 260. Intent is a matter\\npeculiarly within the province of the\\ntrier of facts, in this case the jury.\\n\\n“In Turner v. Biscoe, 141 Tex. 197,\\n171 S.W.2d 118, 119, the Texas court\\nstated:\\n\\n“The governing principles of law\\nare familiar. A person’s intention is\\na matter of fact. When a promise is\\nmade the promisor expressly or by\\nnecessary implication states that he\\nthen has a present intention to per-\\nform, and if such intention does not\\nactually exist at that time, a false\\nstatement of fact has been made upon\\nwhich fraud may be predicated. The\\ngist of the fraud is deception as to an\\nexisting fact, namely, the state of the\\npromisor’s mind. That fact may be\\nestablished by circumstantial evidence\\ntaken in connection with the breach,\\nbut cannot be established by the breach\\nalone.’\\n\\n“Of course, mere failure to perform\\nis not of itself evidence of intent not to\\nperform at the time the promise or con-\\ntract was made. If it were, a mere\\nbreach of contract would be tantamount\\nto fraud. See Brock v. Brock, 90 Ala,\\n86, 8 So. 11; McAdory v. Jones, 260\\nAla. 547, 71 So.2d 526.”\\n\\nHM We agree with appellant that the\\nmere failure to perform is not itself evi-\\ndence of an intention not to perform.\\n\\n\\nee 241\\nDe\\nSomething more is required. In Walker, when he is insolvent or has no reason-\\n\\nthis court found that there was additional\\nevidence introduced other than the failure\\nto perform the promise from which the\\njury could have found that the promise\\n(in that case to insure the plaintiff’s truck)\\nwas made with no intent to procure such\\ninsurance.\\n\\nHM We have carefully read the entire\\nrecord of the evidence in this case, and find\\nthat no evidence was offered which would\\npermit an inference that the policy was\\nissued to the Woodalls without any inten-\\ntion to pay claims thereunder. The only\\nevidence in the record to prove the allega-\\ntions of the first claim was that the claims\\nwere not paid when submitted by Mr.\\nWoodall. Absent some proof that there\\nwas something more than a failure to pay\\nthe claims, something upon which the jury\\ncould infer that at the time the policy was\\nissued that the company had no intention\\nto honor the claims, it was error to submit\\nthis claim to the jury.\\n\\nHE We are not departing from our\\nprevious cases which recognize that gen-\\nerally intent can only be shown by circum-\\nstantial evidence. However, we simply\\nfind no such evidence in this record. Nor\\nare we departing from the well-recognized\\nrule of our cases that if some condition\\nexisted at the time of the issuance of the\\npolicy which would have prevented the\\ncompany’s ability to perform, and that such\\ncondition was known to the company, that\\n\\ncircumstance would impose a duty on the\\n\\ncompany to disclose such information to\\nthe applicant for insurance. If it fails\\nto disclose these conditions, it leaves itself\\nopen for a suit for fraud. In any con-\\ntractual arrangement, a duty is imposed on\\nthe parties to the contract to disclose cer-\\ntain material facts; for example, the in-\\nability of one to perform the promise made.\\nIn Mazer v. Brown, 259 Ala. 449, 452, 66\\nSo.2d 561, 564 (1953), it was held:\\n\\nThat principle has been held\\nto apply to a buyer of goods on credit\\n\\nable expectation of being able to pay\\nfor them, and he fails to disclose to the\\nseller his condition and the seller is ig-\\nnorant of it.. 7\\n\\nWe find, however, no proof in this case\\nthat any condition existed known to the\\ncompany that it was not able to perform\\nthe promise made under the contract.\\nSuch proof would have permitted an action\\nbased upon fraud.\\n\\nHl The foregoing is dispositive of ap-\\npellant’s argument that no cause of action\\nin tort can be stated when an insurance\\ncompany fails to pay a claim. Under facts\\nfrom which the trier of fact could con-\\nclude that it had no intention to pay such\\nclaims at the time the policy was sold, a\\ncause of action for fraud may be estab-\\nlished.\\n\\nWe turn now to the second theory of\\nrelief. In this claim, Mr. Woodall charges\\nthat the company was guilty of fraud in\\nthat it made fraudulent and false repre-\\nsentations to him which induced him to\\ncontinue to pay premiums on the policy in-\\nvolved, after the claims were denied.\\nWhen Mrs. Woodall was first confined to\\nthe hospital, after the issuance of the poli-\\ncy, her condition was diagnosed as pleural\\neffusion. When that claim was received\\nby the company, the record shows that her\\nmedical records extending back for several\\nyears were acquired by the company.\\nThose records indicated that she had been\\ntreated within five years of the issuance\\nof the policy for congestive heart failure.\\nAccording to the testimony of the solicit-\\ning agent, Mrs. Woodall had responded to\\nquestions on the application for insurance\\nthat the only times she had been confined\\nto the hospital during the preceding five\\nyears were related to a broken hip, She\\nhad had several hospital confinements re-\\nlating to this condition. However, the\\nmedical records, received by the company\\nat the time the first claim was submitted,\\nindicated that she had been hospitalized on\\n\\n\\n242\\n\\nseveral occasions suffering from heart\\ndisease following the hip problem.\\n\\nHt has been held in this jurisdiction\\nthat heart disease is a serious disease and\\nthat the failure to divulge treatment for\\nthis condition in an application for insur-\\nance could increase the risk of loss.\\nVredenburgh v, Liberty National Life In-\\nsurance Company, 246 Ala. 251, 20 So.2d\\n207 (1944). In such cases, the insurer\\nhas a right to seek cancellation of the poli-\\ncy when it discovers that the insured has\\nmisrepresented the existence of this condi-\\ntion. Of course, the trier of the fact must\\nbelieve that the insured had notice that he\\nsuffered from such disease, constructive\\nnotice being insufficient, and that such\\ndenial of the existence of the condition\\nwas made with knowledge that the denial\\nwas false or that the facts concealed were\\nmaterial to the risk. Vredenburgh, supra.\\n\\nUnder the undisputed facts of this\\ncase, Old Southern became aware that\\nMrs. Woodall had been hospitalized a num-\\nber of times suffering from heart disease\\nat the time the first claim was made under\\nthe policy. It did not seek cancellation\\nof the policy, but instead, with that infor-\\nmation in hand,. denied the claim on the\\nground that the condition for which she\\nwas hospitalized was one which originated\\nJess than six months from the date of is-\\nsuance of the policy. The reason given\\nfor the denial of the second claim was that\\nthe condition for which she was hospita-\\nlized on that occasion, at which time she\\nwas diagnosed as having pneumonia of the\\nleft lung, was that the condition was but a\\ncontinuation of the illness for which she\\nwas confined the first time. In other\\nwords, the company informed Mr. Wood-\\nall that the reasons the claims were denied\\nwas that the condition was excluded under\\nthe waiting provision of the policy. Ac-\\ntually, a careful reading of the waiting\\nperiod provision leaves one in doubt that\\nthese two conditions were excluded from\\ncoverage for six months after the date of\\nissue. The excluded conditions do not in-\\n\\nclude respiratory ailments. However, be\\nthat as it may, the company did not dis-\\nclose to Mr. Woodall that the reason it\\nwas denying coverage was based upon its\\nassertion that Mrs. Woodall had misrepre-\\nsented to the company the fact that she\\nhad been treated and hospitalized for heart\\ndisease,\\n\\nIf, in fact, Mrs, Woodall had suffered\\nfrom heart disease, and that fact was\\nknown to her, and she falsely stated in\\nthe application that she had not suffered\\nfrom that malady, the company may have\\nbeen entitled to terminate the policy in its\\nentirety. However, the failure of the com-\\npany to base its denial on this ground, and\\nrather its basing the denial on the ground\\nthat the condition for which she was\\nhospitalized was one which had occurred\\nless than six months after the policy was\\nissued, and was therefore excluded, is evi-\\ndence from which the jury could have\\nfound that the company fraudulently and\\nwith intent to deceive Mr. Woodall con-\\ntinued to accept premiums on the policy,\\nhaving in its possession from the time the\\nfirst claim was submitted information\\nwhich would permit it, on proper proof, to\\ncompletely terminate all coverage under\\nthat policy. This clearly was evidence\\nfrom which the jury could have found that\\nMr. Woodall was fraudulently induced to\\ncontinue paying the premiums on the poli-\\ncy, the company having no intention when\\nit accepted such renewal premium to pay\\nany claims on the policy insofar as Mrs.\\nWoodall’s confinements were concerned.\\n“Where there is evidence reasonably af-\\nfording an inference as to whether a plain-\\ntiff was defrauded the case is\\none for the trier of fact.. . .” Loch\\nRidge Construction Company, Inc. v. Bar-\\nra, 291 Ala. 312, 321, 280 So.2d 745, 752\\n(1973).\\n\\nWe hold, therefore, that the second theo-\\nry sued on stated a claim upon which re-\\nlief could be granted. There was at the\\nvery least a scintilla of evidence to support\\nthat claim. The trial court, therefore, did\\n\\n\\n243\\n\\nnot err in submitting the second claim to\\nthe jury.\\n\\nHJ The third claim asserts that Mr.\\nWoodall suffered damage in that Old\\nSouthern fraudulently and maliciously fail-\\ned to pay the claims made under the policy.\\nThere might be circumstances under which\\nthe failure to pay a claim under a policy of\\ninsurance would create a claim upon which\\nrelief may be granted sounding in tort,\\nbut such circumstances are not presented\\nin this case. Old Southern argues that\\nunder no circumstances could a failure to\\npay a claim be tortious. We need not de-\\ncide that question since, under the record\\nbefore us, there are no circumstances\\nshown which indicate that the company\\ntortiously denied the claim.\\n\\nIn Hamner v. Mutual of Omaha Insur-\\nance Company, 49 Ala.App. 214, 217, 270\\nSo.2d 87, 89, the Court of Civil Appeals,\\nspeaking through Wright, Presiding Judge,\\nhad a similar case. There the court said:\\n\\n“The substance of the allegations of\\nCount Two is that defendant is in the\\nbusiness of selling hospitalization insur-\\nance and sold a policy to plaintiff; that\\nplaintiff filed a claim for benefits under\\nher policy; that defendant delayed ac-\\ntion on her claim for approximately a\\nmonth and then sent an agent to her\\nhome to deny the claim; that the denial\\nof the claim was in violation of the in-\\nsurance laws of the State of Alabama\\n. . . that defendant’s refusal to pay\\nthe claim was oppressive, malicious and\\nfraudulent. Plaintiff then takes more\\nthan two pages of transcript paper to\\ndescribe the oppressive, malicious and\\nfraudulent acts, their effects upon her\\nand the damage she suffered as a result.\\n\\n”\\n\\nThe Court of Civil Appeals concluded that\\nthe allegations of that count did no more\\nthan state an action for breach of contract,\\nand fell short of stating a cause of action\\nin tort. Such we think is the case here.\\n\\nThe third claim for relief simply charges\\nthat the company committed a tort in mali-\\nciously and fraudulently refusing to pay a\\nclaim under the policy. Without more, this\\nclaim sounds in contract.\\n\\nWe agree with Old Southern that the\\ntrial court erred in refusing its motion\\nfor directed verdict as to the first claim,\\nsince there was no evidence that Old\\nSouthern issued the policy with the inten-\\ntion not to pay claims thereunder. We\\ndisagree, however, that the same failed to\\nstate a claim upon which relief could be\\ngranted, assuming such proof had been of-\\nfered. We also agree that the third claim\\nfails to state a claim upon which relief may\\nbe granted sounding in tort. Therefore,\\nthe trial court erred in failing to grant Old\\nSouthern’s motion to dismiss that aspect\\nof the complaint.\\n\\nOld Southern finally argues\\nthat only the third claim: for relief will\\nsupport punitive damages. We disagree.\\nOur cases have uniformly held that punitive\\ndamages may be awarded in actions for\\nfraud, if there is evidence from which the\\njury can conclude that the fraud was mali-\\ncious, oppressive, or gross, and the repre-\\nsentations were made with knowledge of\\ntheir falsity. Hall Motor Co. v. Furman,\\n285 Ala. 499, 234 So.2d 37 (1970); Boriss\\nv. Edwards, 262 Ala. 172, 77 So.2d 909\\n(1954) ; Treadwell Ford, Inc. v. Leek, 272\\nAla. 544, 133 So.2d 24 (1961); J. Truett\\nPayne Co. v. Jackson, 281 Ala. 426, 203\\nSo.2d 433 (1967). Moreover, “. . .\\nThe imposition of punitive damages in\\ncases of fraud and deceit is discretionary\\nwith the jury, acting with regard to the\\nenormity of the wrong and the necessity\\nof preventing similar wrongs. . . .”\\nLoch Ridge Construction Company, Inc.\\nv. Barra, supra, 291 Ala, at 320, 280 So.2d\\nat 751. These principles are applicable to\\nthe second claim.\\n\\nThe trial court submitted the case to\\nthe jury on all three theories, overruling\\n\\n\\n244 |\\n\\nOld Southern’s motion for a directed ver-\\ndict as to each claim for relief. There\\nwas no evidence to support the first claim\\nand the third theory fails to state a claim\\nin tort upon which relief could be granted.\\nThe court erred, therefore, in overruling\\nOld Southern’s motion for directed verdict\\non the first and third claims. For this\\nerror the case must be reversed and re-\\nmanded. Ford Motor Company v.

Hood, Jr., Bessemer, for ap-\\npellant,\\n\\n\\nHarold P, Knight, Birmingham, for ap-\\npellee.\\n\\nEMBRY, Justice.\\n\\nThis appeal by plaintiff below, Catherine\\nWhite, is from final judgment which de-\\nnied her claim to certain items of personal\\nproperty asserted in an action filed against\\ndefendant/appellee Sandra Faye Sims, as\\nAdministratrix of the Estate of Willie\\nSims, deceased. The relief sought by the\\naction was a declaration of the rights of\\nthe parties to personal property described\\nin the complaint. Plaintiff White asserted\\nher right to the described personal proper-\\nty because some of it was the subject of an\\ninter vivos gift from defendant’s decedent\\nWillie Sims; other of it the subject of gift\\nfrom plaintiff\\'s sister, and other of it was\\npurchased by her.\\n\\nThe trial court heard the evidence ore\\ntenus without a jury and declared owner-\\nship of certain of the personal property in\\nWhite, to possession of which she was en-\\ntitled; other of that personal property was\\ndeclared owned by defendant Sims, to pos-\\nsession of which she was entitled. We af-\\nfirm,\\n\\nThe question presented for review is\\nwhether the judgment entered, after hear-\\ning ore tenus of conflicting evidence, was\\n\\n246 —\\n\\nfairly supported by credible evidence and\\nwas not clearly erroneous or manifestly\\nunjust?\\n\\nHE Appellant White contends the trial\\ncourt erred in its judgment awarding two\\nautomobiles and certain other personal\\nproperty to defendant. She argues that\\nproof was made of the essential requisites\\nto show a valid gift to her by decedent\\nWillie Sims of the disputed items. These\\nrequisites, upon which this contention is\\nbased, are enumerated in the representative\\ncases of Vinson v. Vinson, 262 Ala. 388, 79\\nSo.2d 31, and Hudgens v. Tillman, 227 Ala.\\n672, 151 So, 863:\\n\\n“Tt is an essential prerequisite of a\\ngift inter vivos that there must be a\\nclear intention of the donor to make the\\ngift with the donor’s relinquishment of\\nall present and future dominion there-\\nover and a delivery to and acceptance\\nthereof by the donee. Collins v. Baxter,\\n231 Ala. 247, 164 So. 61.” Vinson, su-\\npra,\\n\\nHEE This contention of appellant side-\\nsteps our rule as to scope of review. It is\\nstated above in the question presented for\\nreview. We have carefully examined the\\nrecord containing conflicting evidence as\\nto plaintiff’s contention regarding an inter\\nvivos gift of certain items and ownership\\notherwise of certain other items of person-\\nal property. The final judgment stated:\\n“The testimony was hopelessly and irrecon-\\ncilably in conflict as to these matters.”\\nWe agree. We cannot say there was lack\\nof substantial evidence to support conclu-\\nsions that: (a) there was no clear inten-\\ntion to make a gift, (b) there was no re-\\nlinquishment of dominion and control over\\nsubject, property and (c) there was no ac-\\ntual delivery of subject property. These\\nconclusions were manifest in the judgment.\\n\\n“We cannot substitute our judgment\\nfor that of the trial court as to the ef-\\nfect to be given conflicting oral testimo-\\nny dealing with pivotal questions of fact.\\n\\n* * 4  McCaghren v.

The question in\\neach case was identical and they were con-\\nsolidated. We reverse the judgments and\\nremand the causes for further proceedings.\\n\\nMrs. Croft filed two suits in the Circuit\\nCourt of Madison County, seeking declara-\\ntory judgments under Tit. 7, § 156, Code\\n1940 and Rule 57, ARCP. The issue be-\\nfore the court in each case was whether\\nshe, as beneficiary of the insurance policies\\non the life of her deceased husband, is en-\\ntitled to the proceeds. One suit was filed\\n\\nagainst the Metropolitan Life Insurance\\nCompany (hereinafter Metropolitan) and\\nco-defendants, Shelby Jean Messer Graves,\\nas administratrix of the estate of John\\nJames Croft, Jr., Rebecca Croft Bredeson,\\nJohn Paul Croft, Gloria Ellen Croft and\\nJohnnie. Diane Croft. The second was\\nfiled against Liberty National Life Insur-\\nance Company (hereinafter Liberty Na-\\ntional) and Shelby Jean Messer Graves, in-\\ndividually, as well as the co-defendants\\nnamed in the other suit.\\n\\nMetropolitan and Liberty National filed\\ncross-claims for interpleader under Rule\\n22(a), ARCP. The trial court found these\\ncases proper situations in which to invoke\\ninterpleader and Metropolitan and Liberty\\nNational were discharged as defendants\\nafter paying the sums of $45,450.00 and\\n$10,000.00 respectively into the court.\\n\\nAppellee then moved for a summary\\njudgment in each case, pursuant to Rule\\n56, ARCP. The motions were based on\\nprior pleadings and orders in each case,\\nthe appellee claiming that there was no\\ngenuine issue as to any material fact\\nplaced before the court. Appellants an-\\nswered each motion with counter-affidavits\\nin opposition to summary judgment.\\nThese affidavits consisted of excerpts\\nfrom testimony in the case of State of Al-\\nabama uv. Ruth E. Croft, Case No, 72-126F,\\nfrom the Circuit Court of Madison County,\\nin which appellee was acquitted of the\\nmurder of her husband, John James Croft,\\nJr., the jury finding her not guilty by rea-\\nson of insanity. In response, appellee\\namended her Rule 56 motion to include the\\ncircuit court records finding her not guilty\\nby reason of insanity, the orders for a\\ncompetency hearing, the decrees of mental\\ncompetency of appellee, and the qualifica-\\ntions of Allen Overton Battles, Ph.D.,\\nwhose testimony was introduced in the\\ncriminal trial.\\n\\nThe appellee’s motions for summary\\njudgment were granted, the court having\\nfound in each case that “* * * there is\\nno genuine issue as to any material fact\\n\\n\\nand that the plaintiff is entitled to judg-\\nment as a matter of law, * * *.”\\n\\nSummary judgment is a procedure avail-\\nable only when it is apparent to the court\\nfrom the materials filed before it that\\n“x * * there is no genuine issue as to\\nany material fact and that the moving party\\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of\\nlaw. * * *” Rule 56(c), ARCP.\\n\\nHere, appellee presented to the trial\\ncourt information from the prior criminal\\nproceeding, State v. Croft, supra, to sup-\\nport her motions for summary judgment.\\nThe court considered the information to be\\ndispositive of the facts in the civil cases\\nand entered summary judgments in favor\\nof the appellee. .\\n\\nIn Sovereign Camp W. O. W. v. Gunn,\\n(1), 224 Ala. 444, 140 So. 410, this court\\ncited the following from a West Virginia\\ncase with approval:\\n\\n“In the case of Interstate Dry Goods\\nStores v. Williamson, 91 W.Va. 156, 112\\nS.E. 301, 302, 31 A.L.R. 258, it is said:\\n‘It is uniformly held that a judgment of\\nconviction or acquittal in a criminal case\\nis not proper evidence in a civil case, to\\nestablish the facts which were necessary\\nto be established in order to secure such\\nconviction or acquittal. The parties to\\nthe criminal prosecution are different.\\nThe rules of evidence are different in\\nthe two classes of cases, and the pur-\\nposes and objects sought to be accom-\\nplished are essentially different. * * *\\nThe criminal proceeding is between the\\nstate and the accused party, and seeks\\nvindication of a public right, while in the\\ncivil suit the purpose sought is vindica-\\ntion of purely private rights and inter-\\nests.—Freemen, Judgments, § 319;\\nBlack, Judgments, § 529; R.C.L.

Murphy, (II), 231 Ala. 680,\\n166 So. 604, (1936), and Gunn, (II), supra,\\nare cited, among others, in Roden & Son v.\\nState, 30 Ala.App. 229, 3 So.2d 420, as au-\\nthority for the statement of the general\\nprinciple that “* * * a judgment in a\\ncivil case is not conclusive as res judicata\\nin a criminal case, or vice versa, there being\\nno mutuality of parties and a different de-\\n\\ngree of proof, respectively, being required,\\nek RL\\n\\nHsin accepting the jury verdict of\\nacquittal in State v. Croft, supra, as a ba-\\nsis for summary judgment, the trial court\\nwas implying that all issues in the civil\\ncases were resolved by the facts that\\nevolved in the criminal case, and that no\\nissue of fact continued to exist. We can-\\nnot agree. By definition, an acquittal in a\\ncriminal case does not resolve all factual\\nissues, but leaves factual issues doubtful, as\\nnoted by this court in Fidelity-Phenix\\nFire Ins. Co. of N. Y. v.

The\\ngravamen of the complaint was that the\\nhospital was negligent in attempting to\\nmove a patient with fewer people than was\\nrequired for the patient’s size and condi-\\ntion and, as a result, the patient grabbed\\nonto the plaintiff.\\n\\nThe hospital filed a motion to dismiss,\\nwhich was denied,\\n\\nIt then filed an answer denying the al-\\nlegations of the complaint and charging\\nplaintiff with contributory negligence and\\nassumption of risk,\\n\\nThe case went to trial before a jury. At\\nthe conclusion of the plaintiff\\'s evidence,\\nthe hospital requested the directed verdict,\\nwhich the court granted. From the judg-\\nment entered in the hospital’s favor, the\\nplaintiff appealed.\\n\\nThere are two issues presented. The\\nplaintiff first claims that the trial court\\n\\n\"erred in granting the hospital’s motion for\\n\\ndirected verdict. Next, the plaintiff claims\\nthe court erred in refusing to allow an\\namendment to her complaint.\\n\\nHit is without contradiction that if\\nthere is a scintilla of evidence adduced in\\nsupport of the plaintiff\\'s claim, it is error\\nfor the court to grant defendant’s motion\\nfor directed verdict. The court reporter’s\\nnotes in this case were destroyed by a\\nstorm. The parties have submitted the\\ncase on a stipulated statement of the testi-\\nmony and proceedings which is set out in\\npart:\\n\\n“1, Witness Luttie S. Johnson.\\n\\n“Luttie S. Johnson, the Plaintiff in the\\nabove styled cause, after being duly sworn,\\ntestified as follows:\\n\\n“On or about the 3rd day of March, 1973,\\nI was employed by Mrs, Ella Mae Mott\\nas a registered private duty aide, while\\nMrs. Mott was hospitalized in Room 527 at\\nBaptist Hospital in Montgomery, Alabama\\nas a patient of Baptist Hospital.\\n\\n“My duties pursuant to the employment\\nwith Mrs. Mott included giving the patient\\na bath, changing bed linens, delivering food\\ntrays, keeping the room neat, and making\\nthe patient comfortable. On occasion, I\\nhave worked seven days per week at the\\nhospital as a private duty aide.\\n\\n“Mrs. Mott was a very tall and heavy\\nperson, She had a broken hip and a broken\\narm, both of which were in casts on or\\nabout March 3, 1973.\\n\\n253\\n\\n“Mrs, Mott had to be moved from her\\ned to her chair and back from her chair to\\nher bed periodically during the’ day and it\\nusually took Mr, Perdue, who was an\\norderly employed by Baptist Hospital, and\\nfrom three to four nurses to move Mrs.\\nMott due to her size and her condition.\\n\\n“On or about March 3, 1973, the day that\\nI was injured, Mrs. Mott had already been\\nmoved from the bed to a chair. Two\\nnurses*came in to try to move Mrs, Mott\\nfrom the chair to the bed but they could\\nnot budge her. They left to get Mr. Per-\\ndue, the orderly. Mr. Perdue came into\\nthe room without the nurses and tried to\\nmove Mrs. Mott by himself. He went\\naround to the back of Mrs, Mott’s chair\\nand put his hands under Mrs. Mott’s arms\\nand lifted her. I was very near Mrs. Mott\\n‘because I had to put my foot against hers\\nto keep her stocking feet from slipping on\\nthe floor. As Mr. Perdue was lifting Mrs.\\nMott onto the bed, he caused Mrs. Mott to\\nreach out and grab me and pull me down\\nonto the bed. Mrs, Mott pulling me down\\nonto the bed caused the injury to my back\\nand lower extremities.\\n\\n“Tt appeared that Mrs. Mott was unstable\\nwhile Mr. Perdue was moving her back\\nonto the bed because she reached out and\\ngrabbed me; but, as far as actually falling\\nany certain distance, I can’t testify that\\nshe actually fell any certain distance.\\n\\n“T never actually lifted Mrs, Mott while\\nI was under her employment.\\n\\n“Mr. Perdue stated that the same incident\\nhurt his back also.\\n\\n“Mrs. Mott apologized for pulling on me\\nand hurting my back.\\n\\n“The pain in my back and leg began\\nto grow worse and on the same day,\\nMarch 3, 1973, I went to the emergency\\nroom at Baptist Hospital and filled out a\\nreport on my injury.\\n\\n“There had never been before this inci-\\ndent which caused my injury, less than\\nthree people moving Mrs. Mott while I\\nwas under her employment.\\n\\n“Doctor Thomas Boozer admitted me in\\nSt. Margaret’s Hospital on the same day\\nthat I was hurt for the treatment of my\\ninjuries.\\n\\n“2, Witness Clifford R. Perdue called as\\na witness for the Plaintiff and after being\\nduly sworn testified as follows:\\n\\n“My name is Clifford R. Perdue and I\\nwas employed as an orderly working for\\nBaptist Hospital of Montgomery, Alabama,\\non or about March 3, 1973, In performing\\nmy duties as an orderly for Baptist Hos-\\npital these duties were for the benefit of\\nBaptist Hospital and under the direction of\\nBaptist Hospital. My duties included giv-\\ning baths, making beds, moving patients,\\ncatherization, and giving enemas.\\n\\n“T remembered moving Mrs. Mott on\\nMarch 3, 1973. And, I believe, that there\\nwere three persons, including myself, who\\nmoved Mrs. Mott on March 3, 1973.\\n\\n“I didn’t remember anything about\\nMarch 3, 1973, except that Mr. Byrne told\\nme thats when the accident occurred. I\\nremembered us getting Mrs. Mott up on\\nMarch 3, 1973 but did not remember put- —\\nting her back in bed.\\n\\n“I never attempted to move Mrs, Mott\\nby myself,\\n\\n“Mrs, Mott weighed around 230 to 240\\npounds, had a fractured hip, one leg in a\\ncast, and one arm in a cast, and had arthri-\\ntis in her good leg.\\n\\n“Mrs. Luttie Johnson would stand back\\nwhile we lifted Mrs, Mott and when we\\ngot her up then Mrs, Johnson would make\\nthe bed.\\n\\n“T found that Mrs. Johnson was always\\nvery careful with her patients and would\\noften get upset if we did not come at just\\nthe time that she called.\\n\\n“I don’t remember Mrs, Johnson using\\nher feet to block Mrs. Mott’s feet while\\nwe were getting her up.\\n\\n\\n254\\n\\n“Mrs. Johnson had told me before Mrs.\\nMott was her patient that she could not\\nlift and pull patients because of her back.\\n\\n“I don’t remember whether I was work-\\ning on both the 4th and Sth floors on March\\n3, 1973,\\n\\n“I do not remember ever moving Mrs.\\nMott by myself and for one person to at-\\ntempt to move a patient the size of Mrs.\\nMott, in her condition, would be a failure\\nto use due care and would be unsafe.”\\n\\nI Is there evidence here from which\\nthe jury could have concluded that the\\nplaintiff was injured as a result of the\\nnegligence of the hospital? Clearly, there\\nis, Mr, Perdue testified that it would be\\nunsafe for one person to attempt to move\\na patient the size of Mrs. Mott. Mrs.\\nJohnson testified that Mr. Perdue attempt-\\ned to move her without any help; and that\\nshe was injured because the patient “grab-\\nbed” her and caused her to fall. It is true\\nthat Mr. Perdue said that he did not re-\\nmember ever moving Mrs, Mott by himself,\\nbut Mrs. Johnson testified that he did at-\\ntempt to move her, There was a clear\\nconflict in the evidence in this respect.\\n\\n“In civil cases, a question must go to\\nthe jury, if the evidence, or any reason-\\nable inference arising therefrom, fur-\\nnishes a mere gleam, glimmer, spark, the\\nleast particle, the smallest trace, or a\\nscintilla in support of the theory of the\\ncomplaint.

Since\\nthere was at the least a scintilla of evidence\\nin support of the plaintiff\\'s theory, she\\nwas entitled to have the jury pass on it.\\n\\nHI The plaintiff next contends that the\\ntrial court erred in not permitting an\\namendment to her complaint. The parties\\nhave stipulated that the following occurred\\nat the close of the plaintiff’s case:\\n\\n“At the close of the plaintiff’s case,\\nthe defendant moved the court for a di-\\nrected verdict in favor of the defendant\\nin the chambers of Judge D. WwW. Cros-\\nland.\\n\\n“The grounds, among many, for the de-\\nfendant[’]s request for a directed verdict\\nwas that the plaintiff had alleged in her\\ncomplaint :\\n\\n. the defendant was so negli-\\ngent in attempting to move Ella Mae\\nMott from her bed with a smaller\\nnumber of personnel than had been\\nrequired and needed to move Ella Mae\\nMott on previous occasions as to cause\\nElla Mae Mott to fall, and in breaking\\nher fall, to grab the plaintiff, causing\\nthe plaintiff to fall to the bed of Mrs,\\nMott, and as a proximate consequence\\nthe plaintiff was injured...\\n\\n“and that the plaintiff had not proved\\nthat Mrs. Mott actually fell,\\n\\n“The trial judge indicated he was go-\\ning to grant the Motion for Directed\\nVerdict due to an absence of evidence\\nthat Mrs. Mott actually fell . . .”\\n\\nThe plaintiff then filed motion for leave\\nto amend and offered the following amend-\\nment, which the court refused:\\n\\nthe defendant was so negligent\\nin attempting to move Ella Mae Mott to\\nher bed with insufficient personnel as to\\ncause Ella Mae Mott, while Mrs, Mott\\nwas being moved, to grab the plaintiff\\ncausing the plaintiff to fall to the bed of\\nMrs. Mott, and as a proximate result and\\nconsequence of the negligence .\\n\\nby the defendant, plaintiff sustained\\n\\nThe plaintiff then moved the court for a\\ncontinuance in order to allow the defendant\\n\\n\\n255\\n\\nto prepare its defense to the amended com-\\nplaint, since the defendant stated to the\\ncourt that it was surprised by the “new\\nfacts” alleged in the plaintiff\\'s offered\\namendment. This motion, too, was denied,\\nand the court then directed a verdict in\\nfavor of the defendant.\\n\\nRule 15 of the Alabama Rules of Civil\\nProcedure is reflective of the entire spirit\\nof these rules. Like its Federal counter-\\npart, the Alabama Rules of Civil Proce-\\ndure:\\n\\nwoe assign the pleadings the\\nlimited role of providing the parties with\\nnotice of the nature of the pleader’s\\nclaim or defense and the transaction,\\nevent, or occurrence that has been called\\ninto question; Thus, the strong\\npolicy against variance between pleading\\nand proof that existed at common law\\nthas been rejected.” Wright &\\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure:\\nCivil § 1471 (1971).\\n\\nIn the instant case, the plaintiff filed\\na motion to amend her complaint after the\\ntrial court indicated that it would direct\\na verdict for the defendant, because the\\nplaintiff had failed to prove that the patient\\nactually fell, as alleged in the complaint.\\nRule 15(b), ARCP, provides:\\n\\n“(b) Amendments to Conform to the\\nEvidence. When issues not raised by the\\npleadings are tried by express or implied\\nconsent of the parties, they shall be\\ntreated in all respects as if they had been\\nraised in the pleadings. Such amendment.\\nof the pleadings as may be necessary to\\ncause them to conform to the evidence\\nand to raise these issues may be made\\nupon motion of any party at any time,\\neven_after judgment; but failure so to\\namend does not affect the result of the\\ntrial of these issues. If evidence is ob-\\njected to at the trial on the ground that\\nit is not within the issues made by the\\npleadings, the court may allow the plead-\\nings to be amended and shall do so free-\\nly when the presentation of the merits\\n\\nof the action will be subserved thereby\\nand the objecting party fails to satisfy\\nthe court that the admission of such\\nevidence would prejudice him in the\\nmaintaining of his action or defense upon\\nthe merits. The court may grant a con-\\ntinuance to enable the objecting party to\\nmeet such evidence. An amendment\\nshall not be refused under subdivision\\n(a) and (b) of this rule solely because\\nit adds a claim or defense, changes a\\nclaim or defense, or works a complete\\nchange in parties. The Court is to be\\nliberal in granting permission to amend\\nwhen justice so requires.”\\n\\nThe plaintiff’s original complaint in this\\ncase met the objective of the ARCP, in that\\nit clearly provided the defendant with\\nnotice of the nature of the plaintiff\\'s\\nclaim and set out the transaction, event or\\noccurrence that was complained of. The\\nissue raised by the pleadings was tried.\\nNo amendment was necessary to conform\\nthe pleadings to the proof. However, the\\nplaintiff was clearly entitled to amend to\\nconform to her proof, once the trial court\\nindicated that it would direct the verdict\\nfor the defendant because of a variance\\nbetween the pleading and the evidence. It\\nwas this harshness in the old practice that\\nRule 15 was designed to correct. Rule 15\\nprovides that amendments are to be allowed\\nfreely when justice so requires, There is\\nnothing in the record before us to indicate\\nthat the defendant was prejudiced in any\\nway by the proffered amendment. Even\\nso, the plaintiff offered a motion for a\\ncontinuance to permit the defendant time\\nto meet the allegations of the amended\\ncomplaint. Under these circumstances, the\\ntrial court should have permitted the\\namendment. :\\n\\nFor the reasons stated, the cause is\\nreversed and remanded.\\n\\nReversed and remanded.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Bush, 293\\nAla. 535, 307 So.2d 6 (1975), the appeal\\nwas dismissed since there was no final\\njudgment to give this court jurisdiction.\\n\\nIn the original complaint, as amended,\\nthe plaintiff sought to sell certain lands\\nfor division with the proceeds to be divided\\namong claimants thereto, and the commut-\\ned value of the plaintiff\\'s life estate to be\\ndetermined and paid to the plaintiff, Fred\\nBush. The defendants filed a cross com-\\n\\n\\n258\\n\\nplaint asking for an accounting based upon\\ntheir claim that, as heirs of S. D, Bargan-\\nier, they held a three-fourth’s interest in\\nthe property in question.\\n\\n‘The following facts, as found by the\\ntrial court, were undisputed:\\n\\nThe testator, S. D. Barganier, had no is-\\nsue. His wife, Martha Jane Perry Gaf-\\nford, had a three-year-old daughter, Eliza-\\nbeth, by a previous marriage when she\\nmarried S. D, Barganier in 1874, Eliza-\\nbeth was reared in the Barganier home\\nand was treated as Mr. Barganier’s daugh-\\nter, although no formal adoption was\\never effected. Elizabeth, upon attaining\\nage, married John W. Bush. The Bushes\\nhad four children, Ila Mae Bradley, Mattie\\nLucile Parker, Cumi Bush, and Fred N.\\nBush, all of whom were stepgrandchildren\\nof the testator, S. D. Barganier. John W.\\nBush died in 1903 and, upon his death,\\nElizabeth returned to Greenville, the home\\nof S. D. Barganier. Her youngest child,\\nFred N. Bush, at approximately age three,\\nmoved into the Barganier home and was\\ncared for by his step-grandfather, S. D.\\nBarganier, and his grandmother. Fred N.\\nBush was reared in the Barganier home\\nand was living there at the time of the\\ndeath of S. D. Barganier. Sometime later\\nElizabeth Bush returned to a home pro-\\nvided her and her other three children by\\nMr, Barganier which home was adjacent to\\nhis. Mattie Lucile Parker married and\\nmoved out before S. D. Barganier died.\\nCumi Bush was living in the home of S. D.\\nBarganier at the time of his death. In\\n1916, Ila Mae Bradley died and was sur-\\nvieved by one child, Frederick Bradley,\\nwho was born in 1909. Frederick Bradley\\nwent into the home and was reared by his\\nstep-great-grandfather, S. D. Barganier,\\nand his great-grandmother. S. D. Bargan-\\nier died on June 19, 1918, having executed\\nhis last will and testament on April 5,\\n1918, during his last illness. At the time\\nof Mr. Barganier’s death, his heirs and\\nnext of kin consisted of feur living sisters\\nand twelve nieces and nephews, who were\\n\\nthe offsprings of two deceased sisters and\\none deceased brother.\\n\\nMr, Barganier’s widow died in 1935.\\nCumi Bush died in 1928 and Mattie Lucile\\nParker died in 1932, before the death of\\nthe widow, Martha, Frederick Bradley\\ndied in 1952,\\n\\nThe single issue presented here is what\\ninterest in the real estate of S. D. Bargan-\\nier does Fred Bush now have under the\\nwill of S. D. Barganier.\\n\\nBy Item Two of Mr. Barganier’s will, he\\nleft all of his property, both real and per-\\nsonal, to his wife, Martha J. Barganier, to\\nbe held and used by her during her life-\\ntime. This item also gave to Martha full\\npower and authority to sell and convey any\\nor all of the personal and real property.\\nItem Two provides “. . . While I\\nhave limited the bequest and devise of all\\nthe property of my estate to the life of my\\nwife, it is my will and desire, that she may\\nsell or dispose of, at any time, either at™\\nprivate or public sale, any or all of my\\nproperty for her own use But\\nmy said wife shall not have power or au-\\nthority to dispose of any of the property of\\nmy estate by will or to take effect after\\nherdeath . . .”\\n\\nItem Three is set out in its entirety since\\nit is this item with which we are concerned:\\n\\nITEM THREE\\n\\n“It is my will and I so direct that out\\nof the moneys and personal property that\\nremains after the death of my said wife\\nand undisposed of by her, all of her\\ndebts, funeral, burial expenses and the\\nexpenses of erecting a suitable tombstone\\nover her grave shall first be paid, and all\\nof the residue of my personal property\\nleft after the death of my wife including\\nmoneys, choses in action and all other\\nspecies of personal property shall vest in\\nand be divided, share and share alike,\\namong Mattie Lucile Parker, Cumi Bush,\\nFred N. Bush and Frederick Bradley,\\n\\n\\nson of Ila Mae Bradley. Whatever re-\\nmains of the real property of my estate\\nat the time of the death of my said wife\\nand not disposed of by her, I give and\\ndevise into Mattie Lucile Parker, Cumi\\nBush, Fred N. Bush and Frederick\\nBradley during their life and no longer,\\nand the remainder in all of said real\\nproperty shall revert to and become the\\nproperty of my estate, to be divided ac-\\ncording to law among my next of kin.\\nProvided, that at the time of the death\\nof either of the above named devisees\\nhis or her share shall at once revert to\\nmy estate and be disposed of according\\nto the laws of descent and distribution.\\nProvided, further, that if said life ten-\\nants of said real property shall fail to\\npay the taxes at any time when it shall\\nbecome due, and said real property or\\nany part thereof is subjected to a sale\\nfor taxes, then and in that event the\\nwhole of the real property in which a\\nlife estate is given to them shall at once\\nrevert to and become a part of my estate\\nto be disposed of as hereinabove direct-\\ned. Provided further, that if either of\\nsaid devisees shall sell or convey his or\\nher share in said real property at any\\ntime, that his or her life estate shall at\\nonce terminate and revert to my estate\\nto be disposed of according to law as\\nabove directed.”\\n\\nThe question presented is whether the\\ntestator intended a gift to individuals or\\ndid he intend a class gift. If the former\\nwas intended, then as each individual died,\\nhis interest lapsed and that interest, under\\nthe terms of the will, reverted to the\\nheirs of the testator. If a class gift was\\nintended, then the surviving members of\\nthe class took a life estate in the property,\\nwith the last survivor, in this case Fred N.\\nBush, being entitled to a life estate in the\\nwhole of the property for the remainder of\\nhis life.\\n\\nThe trial court found that the testator\\nintended that each life tenant should have\\nthe use, benefit and enjoyment of the prop-\\nerty to continue “. . . undiminished\\n\\n259\\n\\nfor each said devisee until the death of the\\nlast surviving life tenant. ”\\n\\nTH It is admitted on all sides that the\\nintention of the testator is the law of the\\nwill, and that the will should be considered\\nas a whole, giving effect to each provision,\\nif possible, to effectuate the intention of\\nthe testator. Davis v. Davis, 289 Ala. 313,\\n267 So.2d 158 (1972).\\n\\n‘The appellants are the heirs at law and\\nnext of kin of the testator. They contend\\nthat the trial court erred in its conclusion\\nthat the last survivor of the four named\\nlife tenants was entitled to the benefits and\\nenjoyment of the property to the exclusion\\nof the heirs and next of kin of the testa-\\ntor.\\n\\nHE We agree. Although the first rule\\nin construing a will requires any court to\\ndetermine to the extent that it can, the in-\\ntention of the testator, certain rules of\\nconstruction have developed over the years\\nto aid the court in this quest. One rule of\\nlong standing is designed to aid the court\\nin determining whether a testator intended\\na gift to individuals or to a class. If the\\ngift is to an individual, it lapses if the in-\\ndividual fails to survive the testator or\\nfails to survive the holder of the antecedent\\nestate and, of course, a life estate ceases\\nupon the death of the life tenant. Re Allen,\\n44 L.T.R. (N.S.) 240 (Ch.D,1881). Con-\\ntrarily, the very function of a class is,\\nin effect, “to provide survivorship among\\nthe members of a group when the testator\\nhas failed to do so but would probably be\\nbest pleased with that distribution.” Coo-\\nley, What Constitutes a Gift to a Class,\\n49 Harv.L.Rev. 903, 912 (1936).\\n\\nHB In making that determination, it\\nis entirely appropriate to inquire into the\\nstate of the testator’s circumstances, in-\\ncluding his family situation, Here the\\ntrial court did that and concluded, in ef-\\nfect, that the testator intended a class gift.\\nWe find ourselves in disagreement with\\nthis conclusion. As a general rule, where\\na testator names the individuals by name,\\nthere is a presumption that he intended to\\n\\n\\n260\\n\\nmake a gift to individuals and not to a\\nclass. Simes, The Law of Future Inter-\\nests, West Publishing Company (1961);\\nWesterfelt v. Smith, 202 Iowa 966, 211 N.\\nW. 380 (1926); Frost v. Courtis, 167\\nMass. 251, 45 N.E. 687 (1897); In re Mur-\\nphy\\'s Estate, 157 Cal. 63, 106 P. 230\\n(1909) ; In re Kimberly\\'s Estate, 150 N.Y.\\n90, 44 N.E. 945 (1896).\\n\\nOf course, this presumption may be\\novercome if there is language in the will to\\nindicate a contrary intent on the part of\\nthe testator. One commentator has said:\\n\\nWhen the testator appears\\nto have been so interested in the welfare\\nof a group to whom he was giving some-\\nthing that, had he thought of it, he\\nwould have wanted those members who\\nsurvived him to take it all in preference\\nto having part of it lapse. [The court\\nshould conclude that he intended a gift\\nto aclass.] . . .” 49 Harv.L.Rev.,\\nsupra, at 930. ,\\n\\nHl We find no such indication of that\\nintention here. On the contrary, the will\\nof Mr. Barganier is replete with language\\nwhich indicates that he intended a gift to\\neach of the named individuals. He direct-\\ned that Mattie Lucile Parker, Cumi Bush,\\nFred N. Bush and Frederick Bradley\\nshould have a life estate in his property\\n(assuming it was not disposed of by his\\nwidow) “during their life and no longer.”\\nIt provided that at the time of the death of\\neither of the above devisees, “his or her\\nshare shall at once revert to my estate and\\nbe disposed of according to the laws of de-\\nscent and distribution”; additionally, “if\\neither of said devisees shall sell or convey\\nhis or her share in said real property at\\nany time, that his or her life estate shall at\\nonce terminate and revert to my estate\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n\\nAll of these expressions are indications\\nthat the testator intended a gift to the\\nnamed individuals and not a gift to a class.\\nEach was devised an undivided one-fourth\\ndefeasible interest in the property for life.\\n\\nThe only language in the will to indicate a\\ncontrary intent is the use of the words\\n“during their life and no longer.” (Em-\\nphasis supplied)\\n\\nAppellee argues that this indicates that\\nMr. Barganier intended to create a life es-\\ntate in all of’ them, the interest of each\\npassing upon his or her death to the suc-\\ncessors, down to the last survivor. To\\nadopt this construction is to ignore several\\nother expressions which clearly indicate\\nthat Mr, Barganier intended the interest of\\neach of the named individuals to revert to\\nhis estate on the death of either of them,\\nor if either of them attempted to sell his or\\nher share, Every expression in the will,\\nwith the exception of the use of the words\\n“during their life” indicates that he intend-\\ned to leave each of the named individuals\\nan undivided one-fourth interest in his\\nproperty for the term of the life of each,\\n\\nTwo of the named devisees died during\\nthe lifetime of the widow. Their interests\\ntherefore lapsed and never ripened into a\\nright of possession. Upon the death of the\\nwidow, Frederick Bradley and Fred Bush\\neach took an undivided one-fourth interest\\nin the property for life. When Frederick\\nBradley died in 1952, his interest terminat-\\ned and reverted to the heirs of S. D. Bar-\\nganier under the terms of the will. Fred\\nBush, therefore, holds an undivided one-\\nfourth interest in the property for the term\\nof his natural life.\\n\\nMcWhorter v. Cox, 209 Ala. 233, 234, 96\\nSo. 71, 72 (1923), involved a deed executed\\nby Thomas A. Cox, the father of Bettie\\nCox McWhorter and Boyd Cox, which\\nconveyed to his two children certain prop-\\nerty, with the following language:\\n\\n“For and during their natural lives\\n\\nand from and after their decease to their\\nheirs at law, the following described real\\nestate,’\\n\\n“‘To have and to hold unto said par-\\nties of the second part for and during\\ntheir natural lives and after their de-\\n\\n. cease to their heirs at law in fee simple.”\\n\\n\\nIn construing that deed, this court said:\\n\\n“, . . It is also evident from this\\ndeed Thomas A, Cox intended to and did\\nconvey to Bettie Cox and Boyd Cox, his\\ntwo children, and each thereby became\\ninvested with an undivided one-half in-\\nterest in all the real estate described\\ntherein, for and during their natural\\nlives, and on the death of either, his or\\nher heirs became entitled to immediate\\npossession of the one-half interest in\\nwhich their ancestor had a life interest.\\nThe right to the possession of the half\\ninterest in the land of either Bettie or\\nBoyd Cox by the heirs of either was not\\nlimited to death of both Bettie and Boyd\\nCox, but is limited to the death of their\\nrespective ancestor. Upon the death of\\neach life tenant their children, respec-\\ntively, took the fee of an undivided one-\\nhalf interest in the land. .” (209\\nAla. at 235, 96 So, at 72)\\n\\nSo here, each of the four named life ten-\\nants were entitled to an undivided one-\\nfourth interest in all of the real estate of\\nS. D. Barganier for and during their natu-\\nral lives; and upon the death of each life\\ntenant, the heirs at law and next of kin of\\nS. D. Barganier took the fee of an undi-\\nvided one-fourth interest in the land in-\\nvolved, Since two of the life tenants\\nfailed to survive the widow, the interest of\\neach lapsed and became a part of the re-\\nversionary estate of the testator. The oth-\\n\\ner two one-fourth interests became vested.\\n\\nin Frederick Bradley and Fred Bush upon\\nthe death of the widow of S. D. Barganier.\\nWhen Frederick Bradley died, his interest\\nterminated and title to the property was\\nvested in fee simple in the heirs of S. D.\\nBarganier subject only to the outstanding\\ninterest of Fred Bush. Fred Bush there-\\nfore has an undivided one-fourth interest\\nin the property for the remainder of his\\nlifetime.\\n\\nAppellee argues that Hedricks v. Beam,\\n241 Ala. 618, 4 So.2d 176 (1941), compels a\\ndifferent result. We cannot agree. The\\ndeed in that case contains language which\\n\\n261\\n\\nclearly indicated that the grantor intended\\nthat the remaindermen would not take an\\ninterest in the property until the death of\\nthe last surviving life tenant. In that case\\nthe habendum clause of the deed was as\\nfollows: .\\n\\n““To Have And To Hold, unto the\\nsaid Jesse E, Allen, a life interest in said\\njand together with the right of posses-\\nsion and control of said land for and\\nduring his natural life, and after the\\ndeath of said Jesse E. Allen, Lucy Allen\\nBeam, Ruth Allen Gurley, Dora Allen\\nand Arrieseal Allen Vaughn, each have\\nand own a one-fifth (4%) undivided in-\\nterest in said above described land for\\nand during their natural lives and the\\nsaid Maurice Goble and Annie Sue Goble\\neach have a one-tenth (Yo) undivided in-\\nterest in said land after the death of the\\nsaid Jesse E.

(Ital-\\nics supplied.)” (241 Ala. at 620, 4 So.2d\\nat 177)\\n\\nThis court held that the condition just\\nquoted was effective and meant “, . .\\nthat as long as any of the children or\\ngrandchildren of Jesse E. Allen, named in\\nthe deed, are alive the property granted\\nshall be held intact for the joint benefit of\\nthe grantees. . .” (241 Ala, at 620, 4\\nSo.2d at 178)\\n\\nThere is no language in the will of S. D.\\nBarganier to suggest that he intended that\\nhis heirs would be deprived of the property\\nuntil the death of the last surviving life\\n\\n\\n262 De\\n\\ntenant. On the contrary, there is every in-\\ndication that he intended the interest of\\neach life tenant to terminate and “revert”\\nto his heirs with the death of each as it oc-\\ncurred.\\n\\nWe think the trial court erroneously\\nconcluded that Fred Bush was entitled to a\\nlife estate in the whole of the property of\\nS. D. Barganier, as the last surviving life\\ntenant. We hold that Fred Bush, as a\\nmatter of law, is entitled to an undivided\\none-fourth interest in the property for the\\nbalance of his life.\\n\\nThe judgment appeaied from is, there-\\nfore, reversed and remanded.\\n\\nReversed and remanded.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

We set out the facts leading\\nto the dispute.\\n\\nIn March, 1973, Loeb’s agent, Agnew,\\nlearned that Martin wanted to sell his cot-\\nton for 33 cents a pound. Agnew tele-\\nphoned Martin and asked him if he would\\ntake 33 cents for his cotton. Martin an-\\nswered yes, and stated he was going to\\nplant about the same amount as he had in\\n1972. Loeb, through Agnew, had pur-\\nchased a portion of Martin’s 1972 crop.\\nDuring the telephone conversation, Martin\\nand Agnew arranged a meeting place to\\nclose the trade.\\n\\nWhen they met to discuss the terms of\\nthe contract, Agnew asked Martin how\\nmuch cotton he was going to have. Martin\\n\\n\\n264\\n\\nsaid he was going to plant 400 acres or\\nmore. Agnew said, “Well, I will buy 400\\nacres.” Agnew made a handwritten memo-\\nrandum of the agreement. The pertinent\\npart of the agreement is as follows:\\n\\n“SALE & PURCHASE AGREEMENT.\\n1973 COTTON CROP.\\n\\nWe confirm having purchased from\\nD. L. Martin, Jr. Courtland, Ala.\\nALL COTTON PRODUCED ON 400\\nACRES. PRICE 33.00¢ lb. Crop Run.\\n\\nAt the time of the agreement, Martin\\nhad not planted his crop. Subsequently, he\\nplanted cotton in two patterns: one pattern\\nknown as “solid” pattern where rows are\\nplanted consecutively, and the other known\\nas “two and one skip row,” where two\\nrows are alternated with one row of idle\\nland. Martin’s “solid” row planting was\\n163.2 acres, while his “skip row” planting\\nwas 342,2 acres.\\n\\nMartin’s cotton allotment for 1973 was\\n401.9 acres. The A.S.C.S. office calculated\\nMartin had 163.2 acres of solid row cotton,\\nand 229.6 acres of skip row, totaling 392.8\\nacres of cotton, A.S.C.S. subtracted the\\nidle land in the skip row pattern in arriv-\\ning at its figure of 229.6 acres, It did not\\ncount one-third of the land used in the skip\\nrow planting.\\n\\nThe market price of cotton had doubled\\nin the fall of 1973 from what it was in the\\nspring. And, in September or October,\\nMartin called Agnew to ask if they were\\ngoing to divide the cotton as they had in\\n1972, Agnew replied, he guessed so, and\\nthen he asked Martin if he had planted\\nmore cotton than he sold. Martin said,\\n“Yeah,” and told Agnew that he had plant-\\ned over 500 acres. He told Agnew, “I am\\ngoing to deliver you acres of land this year\\ninstead of acres of cotton.” Agnew re-\\nplied, “We can’t take that.” Thus, the dis-\\npute arose.\\n\\nMartin contended the contract called for\\nhis delivering all cotton produced on 400\\n\\nacres of land. Loeb contended the con-\\ntract meant that Martin was to deliver 400\\nacres of cotton, Martin eventually deliv-\\nered his entire cotton crop to Loeb under\\nprotest, and reserved the right to litigate\\nthe extent of his obligation under the con-\\ntract, The parties stipulated that if Mar-\\ntin was correct, his damages would be\\n$12,516.25.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of Loeb’s evidence, the\\ntrial court directed a verdict for Martin,\\non his written motion. Loeb’s motion for\\nnew trial was denied.\\n\\nIssues\\n\\nThe primary issue is whether the trial\\ncourt was correct in granting the motion\\nfor a directed verdict. Another issue is\\nwhether the trial court improperly exclud-\\ned evidence of customs and usage.\\n\\nThe Directed Verdict.\\n\\nRule 50, Alabama Rules of Civil Proce-\\ndure, providing for directed verdicts, is\\nidentical to Rule 50 of the Federal Rules\\nof Civil Procedure, except for expansion\\nof time limits therein from 10 to 30 days\\nand express retention of the scintilla evi-\\ndence rule under Subsection (e). The mo-\\ntion for directed verdict performs the\\nfunctions of motion to exclude the evi-\\ndence, demurrer to the evidence, and mo-\\ntion for the affirmative charge. See Com-\\nmittee Comments.\\n\\nProfessor Moore says the directed ver-\\ndict is normally used in two’ overlapping\\ncategories of cases: First, where there is a\\ncomplete absence of pleading or proof on\\nan issue or issues material to the cause of\\naction or defense, and second, where there\\nare not any controverted issues of fact\\nupon which reasonable men could differ.\\nMoore’s Federal Practice, Vol. 5A, p. 2317.\\n\\nIn this case we are concerned with the sec-\\nond category. Were there no controverted\\nissues of fact upon which reasonable men\\ncould differ? What standard do we use\\n\\n\\n265\\n\\nto determine the absence of any contro-\\nverted issues of fact?\\n\\nIn Brady v. Southern Railway, 320 U.S.\\n476, 64 S.Ct. 232, 88 L.Ed, 239 (1943), the\\nSupreme Court of the United States an-\\nnounced the standard under the Federal\\nRules of Civil Procedure, in the following\\nterms:\\n\\n“When the evidence is such that with-\\nout weighing the credibility of the wit-\\nnesses there can be but one reasonable\\nconclusion as to the verdict, the court\\nshould determine the proceeding by non-\\nsuit, directed verdict or . . without\\nsubmission to the jury, or by judgment\\nnotwithstanding the verdict. . . .”\\n\\nBut, where there is conflicting evidence or\\nwhere there is insufficient evidence, the\\nSupreme Court says a directed verdict is\\nimproper. Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U.\\nS. 53, 69 S.Ct. 413, 93 L.Ed. 497 (1949) ;\\nContinental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &\\nCarbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S.Ct. 1404,\\n8 L.Ed.2d 777 (1962). In this last cited\\ncase, Continental sued under § 4 of the\\nClayton Act to recover private treble dam-\\nages, and alleged violations of §§ 1 and 2\\nof the Sherman Act. The jury returned a\\nverdict for the defendants. The Court of\\nAppeals had held that there was insuffi-\\ncient evidence to justify a jury finding,\\nand the defendant should have gotten a di-\\nrected verdict. The Supreme Court said\\nthe Appeals Court erred by failing to view\\nevidence in the light most favorable to the\\nplaintiffs, and by not giving them benefit\\nof all inferences which the evidence fairly\\nsupported; it was the jury’s function to\\nweigh the evidence and the inferences to\\nbe drawn therefrom, and to come te an ul-\\ntimate conclusion as to the facts. The\\ncourt ordered a new trial.\\n\\n‘The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held\\nin Herron v. Maryland Casualty Co., 347\\nF.2d 357 (1965), that the trial judge may\\ngrant a directed verdict only when there is\\nno evidence, which, if believed, would au-\\nthorize a verdict against the movant. The\\ntrial judge must draw against the movant\\n\\nall reasonable inferences most favorable to\\nthe party opposing the motion. The case\\nmust be submitted to the jury if reasonable\\nmen may reach different conclusions. Cf.\\nGeddes v, Daughters of Charity of St.\\nVincent De Paul, Inc., 348 F.2d 144 (Sth\\nCir. 1965). And, in Boeing Co. v. Ship-\\nman, 411 F.2d 365 (Sth Cir. 1969) a “SUB-\\nSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OR REASON-\\nABLE MAN TEST” was set out, as fol-\\nlows:\\n\\n“On motions for directed verdict and\\nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict\\nthe Court should consider all of the evi-\\ndence—not just that evidence which sup-\\nports the non-mover’s case—but in the\\nlight and with all reasonable inferences\\nmost favorable to the party opposed to\\nthe motion, If the facts and inferences\\npoint so strongly and overwhelmingly in\\nfavor of one party that the Court be-\\nlieves that reasonable men could not ar-\\nrive at a contrary verdict, granting of\\nthe motions is proper. On the other\\nhand, if there is substantial evidence op-\\nposed to the motions, that is, evidence of\\nsuch quality and weight that reasonable\\nand fair-minded men in the exercise of\\nimpartial judgment might reach different\\nconclusions, the motions should be de-\\nnied, and the case submitted to the jury.\\nA mere scintilla of evidence is insuffi-\\ncient to present a question for the jury.\\nThe motions for directed verdict and\\njudgment n.e.v. should not be decided by\\nwhich side has the better of the case, nor\\nshould they be granted only when there\\nis a complete absence of probative facts\\nto support a jury verdict. There must\\nbe a conflict in substantial evidence to\\ncreate a jury question. However, it is\\nthe function of the jury as the tradition-\\nal finder of the facts, and not the Court,\\nto weigh conflicting evidence and infer-\\nences, and determine the credibility of\\nwitnesses,”\\n\\nIt will be noted that the Federal Court\\ndoes not have the scintilla rule, while our\\n\\nRule 50(e) retains it. This subsection spe-\\ncifically states that the court may direct a\\n\\n266\\n\\nverdict, or enter judgment notwithstanding\\nthe verdict under this rule, whether or not\\nthe party making the motion has the bur-\\nden of proof, in accordance with the scin-\\ntilla evidence rule,\\n\\nIn Noonan v. Midland Capital Corpora-\\ntion, 453 F.2d 459 (2d Cir. 1972) the “Rea-\\nsonable Man Test” was applied. The court\\nsaid,\\n\\n“We apply, of course, the accepted\\nrule that ‘[w]hether the motion is one to\\ndirect a verdict or to set aside a verdict\\nwhich the jury has returned, the test ap-\\nplied by the court is the same. The evi-\\ndence must be viewed in the light most\\nfavorable to the party other than the\\nmovant. The motion will be granted\\nonly if (1) there is a complete absence\\nof probative evidence to support a ver-\\ndict for the non-movant or (2) the evi-\\ndence is so strongly and overwhelmingly\\nin favor of the movant that reasonable\\nand fair minded men in the exercise of\\nimpartial judgment could not arrive at a\\nverdict against him.’ ”\\n\\nHMM Whether the “Reasonable Man\\nTest” or the scintilla evidence rule is ap-\\nplied here, the result is the same: the trial\\ncourt erred in directing a verdict against\\nLoeb. In reviewing the evidence, we find\\nMartin saying to Agnew, “I am going to\\ndeliver you acres of land this year instead\\nof acres of cotton,” and Agnew replying,\\n“We can’t take that.” And, also, the\\nagreement is subject to two interpretations.\\nMartin’s evidence was that he intended the\\nphrase in writing to mean, “All cotton\\nplanted on 400 acres of land,” and Agnew\\nsays he intended the phrase to mean “400\\nacres of cotton.” Moreover, there was evi-\\ndence that it takes 3 acres of land to make\\ntwo acres of cotton when the cotton is\\nplanted the skip row pattern; that Mar-\\ntin’s allotment for 1973 was 401.9 acres;\\nthat the A.S.C.S. office calculated Martin\\nhad 163.2 acres of solid row cotton and\\n229.6 acres of skip row, totaling 392.8\\nacres of cotton, and‘evidence of the 1972\\ncrop under similar contracts. We are of\\n\\nthe opinion the evidence was insufficient\\nfor a “one way” verdict, and the directed\\nverdict was improper.\\n\\nEvidence of Custom and Usage\\n\\nHn explaining the reasons for his\\ndecision to direct a verdict for Martin, the\\ntrial court said:\\n\\n“What in effect has happened is, the\\nCourt has ruled, by declining to accept\\nthose witnesses as being competent to\\ntestify, in effect that there is no such\\nthing as a custom or usage in the trade\\nconcerning to [sic] forwarding contracts\\nwith reference to cotton.”\\n\\n* * * * * *\\n\\n“Well I think that is set out very well\\nin the latest case, which we have been\\ndiscussing the last day or two, that you\\nonly come into the question of concern-\\ning custom and usage, it only becomes\\napplicable where there is an ambiguity in\\nthe contract, and in this contract, quite\\nfrankly, to me it’s pretty plain outside of\\nthe evidence, but be that as it may, I\\nthink that the defendants haven’t been\\nable to establish by any proof, and I\\nthink, actually, their offer of proof has\\nbeen quite to the contrary, that there is\\nno such thing as a custom and usage in\\nforwarding contracts as pertains to com-\\nmodity of cotton, because that was a\\nshort lived thing in this state and in this\\narea. I mean, that is something that is\\nalmost like mushrooms coming up and\\ndying away forever and to never, never\\nto come back.”\\n\\nThe “latest case” the trial judge was re-\\nferring to in his colloquy was Jewell v.\\nJackson & Whitsitt Cotton Co., 294 Ala.\\n112, 313 So.2d 157 (1975), a case heard ore\\ntenus. In Jewell this court said,\\n\\n“It is undisputed that this contract in\\n1973 was the first time Jewell had ever\\ncontracted or booked his cotton crop; he\\nwas not aware of any custom or usage\\nrelating to the contracting of a cotton\\n\\na 267\\nDe\\n\\ncrop; the first time he ever heard of it\\nwas when this case came up; he was not\\naware of any custom or usage when he\\nsigned the contract.”\\n\\nWe are unable to say Martin was as: un-\\nknowledgable as Jewell apparently was.\\nOtherwise, why would he say to Agnew, “I\\nam going to deliver you acres of land this\\nyear instead of acres of cotton.”\\n\\nEvidence of custom and usage was ad-\\nmissible by virtue of U.C.C. § 2-202, Code\\nof Ala, Tit. 7A, providing that confirma-\\ntory memoranda may be explained by\\ncourse of dealing, or usage of trade. The\\nOfficial Comment to U.C.C. § 2-202 says,\\n\\n“2, Paragraph (a) makes admissible\\nevidence of . . . usage of trade\\nto explain or supplement the\\nterms of any writing stating the agree-\\nment of the parties in order that the true\\nunderstanding of the parties as to the\\nagreement may be reached. Such writ-\\nings are to be read on the assumption\\nthat the usages of trade were\\ntaken for granted when the document\\nwas phrased. Unless carefully negated\\nthey have become an element of the\\nmeaning of the words used.”\\n\\nWhether there was a custom and usage\\nof trade was a question of fact for the\\njury to determine, under the present condi-\\ntions.

The trial court found\\nfor defendants and we affirm.\\n\\nAppellant, Charlotte Statum Holleman,\\nfiled a suit in equity on June 19, 1973, re-\\nquesting that appellees be enjoined from\\nthe maintenance and retention of a monu-\\nment within the five-foot easement sepa-\\nrating the North 4 of Lot 129 and Lot\\n137, Block 10, Elmwood Cemetery, City of\\nBirmingham, and damages, costs and fees\\nin this regard. The complaint was later\\namended to include a count against appel-\\nlees alleging grave desecration.\\n\\nAppellant is owner of the North 4 of\\nLot 129 (hereinafter Lot 129). Appellees,\\nDorothy Sexton Lambert, Ruth Statum\\nPerkins, H. T. Statum, Jr., Betty Joyce\\nHodges, Ruth Gibson, John P. Gibson, Jr.,\\n\\n\\nPauline Jones and Mrs. Mabel Lewis, own\\nLot 137, Each of the aforementioned ap-\\npellees (hereinafter relatives) is related to\\nthe appellant in some degree.\\n\\nLot 137 is due north of Lot 129. The\\nlots are separated by the easement ‘on\\nwhich the monument is situated.\\n\\nAppellee, Elmwood Cemetery Corpora-\\ntion (hereinafter Elmwood), is the owner\\nof the cemetery in which Lots 129 and 137\\nare located. Appellee, Harry Mueller, is\\npresident and general manager of Elm-\\nwood.\\n\\nRelatives originally purchased Lot 137 as\\nan eighteen-grave lot. In order to erect a\\nmonument on the lot commemorating the\\nfamilies to be buried within, a number of\\ngraves would have to be sacrificed. Rela-\\ntives consulted with Mueller, who allowed\\nthem to erect a monument in the easement\\nbetween Lot 137 and Lot 129. (The monu-\\nment is currently situated even with and\\nparallel to the southern boundary of rela-\\ntives’ lot, as a result of realignment of the\\nmonument.on December 5, 1974, by Muel-\\nler. Prior to that date, the monument was\\nthree inches out of line.) This monument,\\n\\nincluding the base, is six feet six inches ©\\n\\nlong, three feet eight inches high, and two\\nfeet wide, and extends two feet into the\\neasement toward and parallel to the north-\\nern boundary of Lot 129, allowing a\\nthree-foot passageway between relatives’\\nlot and appellant’s lot.\\n\\nThe inscription on the monument reads:\\n“Gibson-Statum.” Gibson is the married\\nname of one of appellant’s sisters. Statum\\nis the appellant’s maiden name.\\n\\nThe interments in Lot 137 are appellant’s\\nrelatives, Dr. and Mrs. H. N. Statum, her\\nfather and mother, Reverend H. T. Sta-\\ntum, her brother, a niece, a nephew and\\ntwo brothers-in-law.\\n\\nIn her Dill of complaint, appellant al-\\nleged a conspiracy between all named ap-\\npellees whereby they placed a monument in\\n\\n271\\n\\nthe easement, which reduced the easement\\nto appellant’s lot on the north side to three\\nfeet rather than the original and usual five\\nfeet; that appellees planted shrubs and\\n\\n. plants around the monument which limited\\n\\nthe access even more; that Mueller told\\nappellant he would remove the shrubs and\\nplants, but failed to do so; that relatives’\\nmonument obstructed the view of appel-\\nlant’s lot. Appellant claimed that she ex-\\nperienced emotional and physical damages\\nas a result of these actions of appellees, es-\\npecially at the interment of her grandson\\non July 27, 1970, when the pallbearers ap-\\npeared to have difficulty in placing the\\ncoffin over the grave (in Lot 129). She\\ncomplained that due to the mohument, all\\nof her grandson’s floral sprays had to be\\nplaced on Lot 137 behind the monument,\\nwhich obstructed the view of the sprays.\\nAppellant claims that the emotional and\\nphysical damages alleged have continued\\nsince the date of her grandson’s interment.\\n\\nThe cause came to trial on December 6,\\n1973. On December 21, 1973, after the\\nclose of testimony, but prior to the trial\\ncourt’s ruling on the matter, appellant\\nmoved to reopen the case and to amend her\\ncomplaint. She alleged that one day prior\\nto the trial, or December 5, Mueller had\\nmoved the monument slightly, in an effort\\nto align the north side of the monument\\nprecisely on the southern boundary of Lot\\n137. This movement, appellant contended,\\nresulted in the desecration of the grave of\\nappellant’s aunt, Lora B, Gleason, who is\\nburied in Lot 129.\\n\\nOn January 14, 1974, the trial court en-\\ntered the first of four orders from which\\nthis appeal is brought: FINAL ORDER\\nDISMISSING CAUSE AS TO SOME\\nDEFENDANTS/ORDER SETTING\\nASIDE SUBMISSION AS TO SOME\\nDEFENDANTS. As to relatives, the de-\\ncree stated as follows:\\n\\n“ONE: Plaintiff has failed to reason-\\nably prove to the satisfaction of the\\n\\n\\n272\\n\\nCourt the material allegations of her Bill\\nas against the following Defendants:\\n[relatives listed] and, as to these said\\nDefendants, * * * this cause -is dis-\\nmissed.”\\n\\nThe trial judge continued the case against\\nElmwood and Mueller for the purpose stat-\\ned in appellant’s motion to reopen. Elm-\\nwood and Mueller delayed in answering\\nappellant’s amended complaint, and were\\nfound in default on April 23, 1974.\\n\\nOn May 1, 1974, Elmwood and Mueller\\nmoved to set aside default, which the trial\\njudge so ordered. (This is the second de-\\ncree which appellant challenges.) Elm-\\nwood and Mueller then moved for a hear-\\ning on the merits of the amended com-\\nplaint. It was so ordered. The hearing\\nbegan on May 6, 1974, on what the trial\\njudge termed an “emergency matter”—the\\nneed to cure the desecration of Lora B.\\nGleason’s grave. The trial judge conclud-\\ned the hearing as follows:\\n\\n“* * * let the record show that at this\\nhearing the sole question was whether or\\nnot Elmwood Cemetery would be willing,\\nwithout any admission of liability, to\\nerect some type of curative structure or\\nwall which would alleviate the hole in\\nthe ground which exists, and that would\\nbe done forthwith, that is within a rea-\\nsonable time. * * *”\\n\\nOn October 9, 1974, Elmwood and\\nMueller moved to sever the original cause\\nfrom the amended complaint under Rule\\n21, ARCP, and for summary judgment on\\nthe original complaint pursuant to Rule 56,\\nARCP.\\n\\nOn March 3, 1975, Elmwood and Mueller\\nmoved for summary judgment as to the\\namended complaint. That motion was set\\nfor hearing on March 7, 1975. On that\\ndate, the trial judge entered a decree\\nwhich granted summary judgment on the\\namended complaint in favor of Elmwood\\nand Mueller, (This is the third decree\\nfrom which appellant appeals.)\\n\\nOn March 26, 1975, appellant appealed\\nfrom the three orders or decrees previously\\nlisted. On April 22, 1975, the trial judge\\nentered the final decree on the original\\ncomplaint in favor of Elmwood and Muell-\\ner and against appellant. (This decree is\\nthe fourth of four orders being appealed.)\\nThe court found:\\n\\n“Plaintiff has adequate ingress and\\negress to her lot. She has not been de-\\nnied free and reasonable access. Elm-\\nwood has not interfered with Plaintiff\\'s\\nright to use her lot for burial and visita-\\ntion purposes. The monument’s move-\\nment was a reasonable and legitimate at-\\ntempt to accommodate the owner of Lot\\n137, in marking the burial of those per-\\nsons interred within the lot, including the\\nparents and relatives of the Plaintiff.\\n\\n“There was no conspiracy as averred\\nin Plaintiff\\'s complaint. The said monu-\\nment does not bar the vision of Plain-\\ntiff’s lot, nor does it bar interment in\\nsaid lot.\\n\\n“Defendants did not deal perfidiously\\nwith Plaintiff, mislead her, nor have\\nthey done any injustice to her.”\\n\\nWe discuss the aspects of the case\\nagainst the parties separately, because dif-\\nferent law firms handled each aspect.\\n\\nI. PLAINTIFF\\'S CASE AGAINST\\nRELATIVES.\\n\\nOn January 14, 1974, the trial court dis-\\nmissed relatives as party defendants in this\\naction, based on appellant’s failure to prove\\nthe allegations of her bill of complaint\\nagainst them.\\n\\nThe appeal was not filed on this judg-\\nment until March 26, 1975, over fourteen\\nmonths after the judgment was rendered,\\nThe statute sets a limit of six months.\\nTit. 7, § 788, Code.\\n\\nHl This suit was filed prior to the ef-\\nfective date of ARCP. Most of the pro-\\n\\n\\nceedings took place after that date. The\\nparties appear to be in doubt as to whether\\nthe former rules or ARCP apply. It is not\\nnecessary to address that question. If\\nARCP applies, the judgment was not ap-\\npealable. The decree of the court on Janu-\\nary 14, 1974 did not follow the language of\\nARCP 54(b) and was not appealable. The\\nappeal is due to be dismissed because it\\nwas not a final judgment. Cates v. Bush,\\n293 Ala. 535, 307 So.2d 6; Cherokee Coun-\\nty Hospital Board v. Retail, W. & Dept. St.\\nUnion, 294 Ala. 151, 313 So.2d 514.\\n\\nHH If the former rules applied, it was\\nundoubtedly a final judgment. An appeal\\ncould have been taken within six months,\\nbut it was not taken within that time and it\\nis due to be dismissed. There can be no\\nquestion but that the trial court’s intention\\nwas to dismiss the case against the rela-\\ntives,\\n\\nApart from the question of dismissal, the\\ntrial court found that appellant “failed to\\nreasonably prove to the satisfaction of the\\nCourt the material allegations of her Bill\\nas against the [relatives] * * *,”\\n\\nHBB The trial court, sitting without a\\njury, heard the oral testimony, and the\\nusual presumption prevails that we will not\\ndisturb the decree or judgment on appeal\\nunless plainly erroneous or manifestly un-\\njust. Morris v. Morris, 290 Ala. 41, 273\\nSo.2d 203; Morgan v. Larde, 282 Ala. 426,\\n212 So.2d 594. We cannot say that the\\njudgment was either plainly wrong or un-\\njust.\\n\\nIl. GRAVE DESECRATION\\nAGAINST ELMWOOD.\\n\\nAs a preliminary matter, we ‘con-\\nsider the assignment of error that the trial\\ncourt erred in setting aside the default\\njudgment. It was clearly shown that Elm-\\nwood had no notice and ARCP 55 makes it\\nwithin the discretion of the trial court to\\nset aside an entry of default. We see no\\n\\n273\\n\\nabuse of discretion in the trial court’s ac-\\ntion.\\n\\nIn Hogan v. Woodward Iron Co.,\\n263 Ala, 513, 83 So.2d 248, this court held\\nthat the cause of action for damage to a\\ngrave accrues to the surviving spouse and\\nif there is no surviving spouse then to the\\nnext of kin in the order of their relation to\\nthe deceased; and that all parties occupy-\\ning the same degree of kin should join in\\nany such suit. The reason is that it would\\nsubject the defendant to numerous suits by\\ndifferent parties for the same cause of ac-\\ntion which should be settled in one suit.\\n\\nHl Appellant, while testifying, admit-\\nted that the deceased, Lora B. Gleason,\\nwhose grave was alleged to have been des-\\necrated, had a living sister, and that at the\\ntime of the filing of this suit, twelve other\\nliving persons were the same degree of kin\\nto the deceased, Lora B. Gleason, and yet\\nappellant was the only plaintiff. There\\nwas no etror in the trial court’s ruling on\\nthis question.\\n\\nHM Appellant also argues that the trial\\ncourt erred in granting the motion for\\n\\n“summary judgment which was filed on\\n\\nMarch 3 and entered on March 7, 1975, be-\\ncause the ten-day notice provided for in\\nARCP 56(c) was not given. Counsel for\\nappellant was present in court at the hear-\\ning on March 7 and did not object or call\\nattention, by way of oral or written objec-\\ntion, to the ten-day limitation, The failure\\nto raise the question constitutes a waiver.\\nTkerd v.

We reverse.\\n\\nThe Caudles purchased nine lots in a\\nsubdivision known as Center Point Acres\\nin Talladega County. The lots were. pur-\\nchased over a period of time, extending\\nfrom September 4, 1969 through January 6,\\n1971,\\n\\nThe property was bought subject to an\\nexisting mortgage from Whetstone Homes,\\nInc. to First Federal Savings and Loan\\n\\nAssociation. There were other lots in the\\nsubdivision subject to the First Federal\\nmortgage.\\n\\nOn February 21, 1972, First Federal\\nforeclosed on all of the lots in the subdivi-\\nsion. The sale was en masse rather than\\non a parcel by parcel basis. First Federal\\nbid in the property for $72,183.64. Mr.\\nCaudle did not attend the foreclosure sale,\\nyet, near the time of the sale, he discussed\\nthe amount that would be necessary to\\nclear the title to his lots. He was in-\\nformed the cost would be $1,959.82 per lot.\\nUpon further discussion, First Federal of-\\nfered to quitclaim its interest in the lots\\nfor an amount equal to $1,959.82 per lot\\nminus the consideration paid by the Cau-\\ndles for the lots. The Caudles sought to\\nregain the lots upon the basis of that offer,\\nbut learned that First Federal would not\\ngive him credit for anything more than the\\nnominal consideration appearing in the\\ndeeds. The Caudles had evidence showing\\nthey had paid about $9,000.00 on all their\\nlots.\\n\\nOn February 21, 1973, Mr. Caudle made\\nanother attempt to save at least two of the\\nlots. The recited consideration in the\\ndeeds to the two lots totaled $1,500.00.\\nThe release price set by First Federal was\\n$1,959.82 per lot minus the $1,500.00 recit-\\ned consideration, leaving a total of $2,419.-\\n64 necessary to redeem those two lots.\\nMr, Caudle tendered that amount to First\\nFederal in an effort to redeem. The ten-\\nder was refused by First Federal unless\\nthe Caudles quitclaimed their interest in\\nthe remaining lots to First Federal. There-\\nafter, First Federal demanded the full re-\\nlease price of $1,959.82 per lot for redemp-\\ntion of the lots.\\n\\nAfter learning that First Federal had\\npermitted other owners of lots in the sub-\\ndivision to redeem for $700.00 per lot, the\\nCaudles wrote a letter, through their attor-\\nney, disaffirming the validity of the fore-\\nclosure sale. A suit filed in the U. S. Dis-\\ntrict Court for the Northern District of\\n\\n276\\n\\nAlabama was dismissed for lack of juris-\\ndiction. On April 11, 1974, the Caudles\\nfiled suit in the Circuit Court of Talladega\\nCounty. This was two years and six\\nweeks after the foreclosure sale. The trial\\njudge held that the Caudles had not shown\\nany extraordinary circumstances to justify\\nthe bringing of the action when filed, and\\nthat “the Court is of the opinion that this\\naction was not timely filed.”\\n\\nThe Caudles say the sole issue in this\\ncase is whether the action was timely filed\\nin the Circuit Court of Talladega County.\\nFirst Federal’s attorney at oral argument\\nput the question another way. He asks,\\nwas there any justification for the Caudles\\nwaiting two years before attacking the\\nforeclosure.\\n\\nIn W. T. Smith Lumber Co., where the\\nmortgagor waited nine years before filing\\nhis bill, this court said:\\n\\n“x %* x The statutory period of 2\\nyears within which land may be re-\\ndeemed furnishes, by analogy, the rule\\nfor ordinary cases of this character;\\nand while, in the application of the doc-\\ntrine of laches, courts of equity will be\\nguided largely by the facts of each par-\\nticular case, and they will * * *\\nnever come to the relief of him who,\\nwith a full knowledge of all of the facts,\\nhas acquiesced for such a period of time\\n‘as affords cogent evidence of a waiver\\n\\nand abandonment of the right.’\\nAk OD\\n\\nIn First National Bank of Opp v.

We note that\\nMr. Caudle had conversations with First\\nFederal and its lawyer regarding the right\\nto redeem his property. He also offered to\\nredeem two lots and made a tender, but\\nwas turned down by First Federal because\\nhe would not quitclaim the remaining sev-\\nen lots to it. Mr. Caudle’s lawyer also\\nwrote a letter to First Federal disaffirming\\nthe sale. Caudle tried, without results, to\\nget several lawyers to take his case. There\\nwas a fruitless suit filed in the U. S. Dis-\\ntrict Court. So, we cannot say Mr. Caudle\\nhad abandoned his right to redeem.

Schaefers to Rosemary\\nSchaefers Sandlin. We affirm the denial\\nof the bill to set aside the conveyance and\\nmodify the order declaring the restrictive\\nprovision void.\\n\\nIn 1961, Mary A. Schaefers divided her\\nreal property and conveyed it to her chil-\\ndren, William Schaefers, Jr., Elfreda\\n\\n\\n279\\n\\nSchaefers, Julienne Schaefers, and Rose-\\nmary Schaefers Sandlin. In 1974, Rose-\\nmary conveyed her portion of her mother’s\\nproperty to Edward and Arthur Apel.\\nWilliam Schaefers initiated this suit to set\\naside the Sandlin-Apel conveyance. °\\n\\n“STATE.OF ALABAMA\\n“CULLMAN, ALABAMA\\n\\n“KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE\\nPRESENTS, That Mary A.

However, it is\\nfurther mutually agreed between the\\nparties that the grantee herein is re-\\n\\nWilliam contends that the 1974 convey-\\nance to the Apels violates the restrictive\\nprovision of the 1961 deed. He claims that\\nthe provision manifests his mother’s inten-\\ntion that he and Elfreda would retain for\\nlife the right to reside in the family house,\\n\\nThe 1961 deed from Mary A. Schaefers\\nto Rosemary contained fee simple language\\nin both the granting and habendum clauses,\\nbut it also contained a restrictive provision.\\nOmitting the legal description of the prop-\\nerty conveyed, the deed reads:\\n\\nCORRECTED\\nWARRANTY DEED\\n\\nquired only to furnish a permanent\\nhome for either Elfreda Schaefers, or\\nWilliam Schaefers, Jr., upon their re-\\nquest, however, this request and re-\\nquirement will not and shall not ap-\\nply to either of their dependents or\\nspouse.

And\\nI hereby covenant with the said Rose-\\nmary Schaefers that I am seized in fee\\nof the aforegranted premises, and have\\nthe right to sell and convey the same,\\nand I do hereby warrant the title to the\\naforegranted premises, and agree forever\\nto defend the same from the lawful\\nclaims of all persons whomsoever.\\n\\n“IN TESTIMONY of all which I have\\nhereunto set my hand and seal this the\\n22nd day of November, 1961\\n\\n“WITNESS:\\n\\ns/ James F. Berry\\ns/ Mary A. Schaefers Ls.\\nMary A. Schaefers”\\n\\nwhich is located on the property granted to\\nRosemary. (Elfreda, who now lives with\\nRosemary in another house, has granted\\nRosemary a quit claim deed and is not a\\nparty to this law suit.) William supports\\nhis contentions by arguing that the restric-\\n\\n\\n280\\n\\ntive provision in the 1961 deed created a\\nfee simple subject to a condition subse-\\nquent, and by conveying to the Apels, Ro-\\nsemary has broken the condition.\\n\\nThe Apels argue that the restrictive\\nclause is ambiguous since it conflicts with\\nthe fee simple language in both the grant-\\ning and habendum clauses. They also con-\\ntend that under the rule of construction of\\nHenry v. White, 257 Ala. 549, 60 So.2d 149\\n(1952), the first clause in the deed, i. e., the\\ngrant of an absolute fee simple, prevails.\\nAlternatively, they argue that, even if the\\nrestrictive provision is retained, it does not\\nspecify that the permanent home must be\\nthe old home place and since such a con-\\nstruction would operate as a restraint on\\nalienation, it should not be found without a\\nclear and unequivocal expression of intent.\\n\\nWe first address the defendants’\\nargument that the rules of construction ob-\\nliterate the restrictive provision. We fol-\\nlow the recent case of Wilkins v. Fergu-\\nson, 294 Ala. 25, 310 So.2d 879 (1975),\\nwhich dealt with a fact situation similar to\\nthat of the instant case. Wilkins held that\\nreservations or restrictions following a\\ngranting clause containing words of inher-\\nitance are not necessarily void. In that\\ncase, this Court also stated that the arbi-\\ntrary construction rules, applied to incon-\\nsistent clauses in Henry v. White, supra,\\nwould not control when the intentions of\\nthe parties could be discerned from the in-\\nstrument.\\n\\nFollowing the Wilkins case, we find that\\nMary Schaefers did intend to solicit Rose-\\nmary’s promise to provide a permanent\\nhome for William and Elfreda in consider-\\nation for the conveyance, and that the pro-\\nvision manifests that intention; therefore,\\nit is not void. This finding brings us to\\nthe problems of determining the nature and\\noperation of the provision.\\n\\n[Ml To set aside the Sandlin-Apel con-\\nveyance, the plaintiff must prove that the\\nrestrictive provision is a condition subse-\\nquent, If the provision is a condition sub-\\n\\nsequent, it creates a right of entry in Mrs.\\nSchaefers’ estate which may be exercised\\nby William for a condition broken. The\\nright of entry is not subject to the rule\\nagainst perpetuities in Alabama; therefore,\\nit creates a cloud on title which will en-\\ndure indefinitely. Libby v. Winston, 207\\nAla, 681, 93 So. 631 (1922).\\n\\nHI Thus, Alabama courts do not favor\\nconstruing restrictive provisions in deeds\\nof conveyance as conditions subsequent.\\nAnd in cases where the intention of the\\ngrantor is not clear, this Court prefers to\\nconstrue a restriction as a covenant—not\\nto be confused with a covenant running\\nwith the land—rather than a condition sub-\\nsequent. Hanners v. Hanners, 262 Ala.\\n143, 77 So.2d 484 (1955).\\n\\nHM To be sure, this Court, as recog-\\nnized in Hanners, has held that a restric-\\ntive provision expressing the consideration\\nfor a conveyance may constitute a condi-\\ntion subsequent. A conveyance of property\\nmade under such circumstances is not ab-\\nsolute, and the title thereto may be divest-\\ned upon breach of the condition. This ex-\\nception to the general rule disfavoring con-\\nditions subsequent is set forth in First Na-\\ntional Bank v, McIntosh, 201 Ala. 649, 79\\nSo. 121, L.R.A.1918F, 353, The restric-\\ntive provision in McIntosh—“(Grantee]\\nshall take care of us . . . and\\n\\n. « give us a home with her on said\\npremises”—is materially different from the\\nprovision in the instant case as well as the\\nprovision in Hanners,\\n\\nThe restrictive portion in Mrs.\\nSchaefers’ deed to Rosemary makes no ref-\\nerence to the property conveyed as the per-\\nmanent home which Rosemary is required\\nto furnish, nor does it contain a divestiture\\nor re-entry clause. Rather, it uses the lan-\\nguage, “Failure to perform the above will\\nbe considered a material breach of the con-\\nsideration.” “[A] material breach of the\\nconsideration” connotes the remedy of\\ndamages, not the right of entry. Such a\\n\\n\\n281\\n\\ndrastic remedy as the divestiture of a fee\\nsimple estate must be expressed more pre-\\ncisely than this. Following the Alabama\\ncases which hold that the intention to cre-\\nate a fee simple subject to condition subse-\\nquent must be clearly and unéquivocally\\nexpressed (Lowery v. May, 213 Ala. 66,\\n104 So. 5 (1925))}, we find that the restric-\\ntive language in the deed to Rosemary is a\\ncovenant in the nature of a personal obli-\\ngation, not a covenant running with the\\nland. We, therefore, affirm the trial\\nJudge’s order upholding the Sandlin-Apel\\nconveyance and turn to the final issue for\\nreview—the interpretation of the restric-\\ntion,\\n\\nIn his decree, the trial Judge held the re-\\nstrictive provision of the 1961 deed void,\\nfinding that it did not specify that the per-\\nmanent home would be on the property de-\\nscribed, and that it did impede alienation.\\nWe agree that the restriction does not re-\\nquire the permanent home to be located on\\nthe property described; however, since we\\nhave held that the restriction is a covenant\\nrather than a condition subsequent, we find\\nno necessity to declare it void. The cove-\\nnant to provide William a permanent home\\nupon request does not impede alienation of\\nthe property because it does not state that\\nthe permanent home must be in the family\\nhomeplace or on any other part of the\\nproperty conveyed by Mrs. Schaefers. The\\ncovenant, therefore, is not enforceable\\nagainst the Apels or any subsequent\\ngrantees and constitutes no impediment to\\nalienation because it does not “touch and\\nconcern” the land in question. See Crib-\\nbett, Principles of Real Property at 353\\n(1975). The covenant is merely a personal\\nobligation from Rosemary to William to\\nprovide him a permanent home in some lo-\\ncation if he requests one. Since William\\nhas made no request, Rosemary has not\\nbreached the covenant. The provision re-\\nmains valid within this context.\\n\\nThe trial Judge’s order, therefore, is\\nmodified to hold the restrictive provision\\nof the deed valid insofar as it imposes\\n\\nupon Rosemary a personal obligation to\\nprovide William a home at his request.\\n\\nAFFIRMED IN PART, MODIFIED\\nIN PART, AND RENDERED.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C, J., and MERRILL, MAD-\\nDOX, and SHORES, JJ., concur.\\n\\n828 S0.2d 277\\nFrank ROBERTS, etc.\\nv.\\n\\nBen W.

This was because Or-\\ndinance 1265 had been superseded by Ordi-\\nnance 1271, which was passed January 27,\\n1975, and the instant case was not tried in\\n\\ncircuit court until March, 1975, when the |\\n\\ncourt dismissed the cause on authority of\\n\\n‘USA Oil Corporation v.

At that time,\\nMcKenna, supra, had not been decided.\\n\\nIn McKenna, there is no mention of Or-\\ndinance 1271, but it is referred to in the\\npleadings as “the amendment to Ordinance\\n1265” adopted on January 27, 1975, the\\nsame date that Ordinance 1271 was adopt-\\ned.

Since submission,\\nthe City of Homewood has filed a supple-\\nmental brief which is the brief the city\\nfiled in McKenna. While the request of-\\nfers some advantage in time, we are per-\\nsuaded that it would be fairer to follow the\\nsame action as taken in McKenna. We\\nnever properly had Ordiriance 1271 before\\nus in the instant case; the supplemental\\nbrief is addressed to McKenna and not this\\ncase; we would have to completely disre-\\ngard the question of mootness; and coun-\\nsel representing McKenna have not been\\nconsulted, insofar as we are informed, and\\nthey certainly would be inclined to believe\\nthat this court would follow McKenna as\\nto procedure.

Among the things the Bank wanted\\nto prevent the stockholders from inspecting\\nwere financial statements of borrowers, re-\\nports of examinations of the Bank by fed-\\neral and state regulatory authorities, and\\ninformation which would disclose the sala-\\nries paid to individual employees of the\\nBank. To limit the scope of inspection,\\nthe Bank filed a declaratory judgment ac-\\ntion, The stockholders filed a counter-\\nclaim for the statutory 10% penalty. Both\\nparties filed motions for summary judg-\\nment upon affidavits and depositions,\\n\\nThe trial Court agreed with the Bank\\nthat the inspection should be limited and\\nappointed a Master to determine the scope\\nof permissible inspection. The Court then\\ngranted the Bank’s motion for summary\\njudgment against the stockholders’ counter-\\nclaim for the penalty. The stockholders\\nbrought mandamus to enforce their right\\nto full inspection of the records and filed\\n\\n\\n289\\n\\nan appeal to review the summary judgment\\ndenying the penalty. A writ of mandamus\\nrequiring the trial Court to order the Bank\\nto permit full inspection was granted on\\nAugust 21, 1975, in Ex parte Miles, 294\\nAla. 462, 318 So.2d 697 (1975). The case\\nnow before us is the appeal from the sum-\\nmary judgment on the penalty. The Bank\\nhas filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.\\n\\nThere are two issues for review. First,\\nwhether the Bank’s motion to dismiss the\\nstockholders’ appeal is due to be granted.\\nSecond, if the appeal is not dismissed,\\nwhether the trial Judge erred in granting a\\nsummary judgment against the stockhold-\\ners’ counterclaim for the statutory penalty.\\n\\nI,\\n\\nOn the Motion to Dismiss Appeal\\n\\nThe Bank contends that the stockholders\\nare attempting to appeal from an incom-\\nplete adjudication of the case below. It\\ncontends that ARCP 54(b) prevents the\\n\\nappeal because, when the stockholders ap-\\npealed, the trial Judge had entered a judg-\\nment only upon the counterclaim for the\\npenalty, and the trial Judge had not made\\n“an express determination that there is no\\njust reason for delay and an express direc-\\n\\ntion for the entry of judgment.”\\n54(b).\\n\\nThis Court, in Cates v. Bush, 293 Ala.\\n535, 307 So.2d 6 (1975), discusses the ef-\\nfect of Rule 54(b) and is relationship to\\nAlabama’s prior statutory provisions for\\nappeal and holds that Rule 54(b) neither\\nsuperseded, nullified, nor modified Tit. 7, §\\n754, Code, relating to the finality of judg-\\nments, Cates further observes, “Title 7,\\nSection 754, provides that, except in unusu-\\nal circumstances, appeal must be only from\\na final judgment. Rule 54(b) merely sets\\nout one instance where a judgment may\\nnow be made final although it would not\\nhave been final prior to the adoption of\\n\\nARCP\\n\\n1. Moreover, it has long been recognized that\\nmandamus is the appropriate remedy whenever\\na board of directors refuses its stockholders\\nthe right to inspect corporate records. Ala-\\n\\nthe new rules.” Therefore, to determine\\nwhether the stockholders’ appeal should be\\ndismissed, we must not confine our inquiry\\nto the language of Rule 54(b), but we must\\nlook to all applicable Alabama law.\\n\\nOur inquiry must begin with a review of\\nthe procedural posture of this case at the\\ntime of the stockholders’ appeal. The order\\nof the trial Judge, the subject of this ap-\\npeal, primarily did two things. First, it\\ndenied the stockholders’ demand for unlim-\\nited inspection and appointed a “Special\\nMaster” to inspect the Bank’s records to\\ndetermine which records the stockholders\\nshould be allowed to inspect. Second, it\\ngranted the Bank’s motion for summary\\njudgment on the counterclaim for the stat-\\nutory penalty.\\n\\nThe stockholders brought mandamus to\\ncompel full inspection and brought appeal\\nto revise the order denying the statutory\\npenalty. A writ of mandamus was granted\\nin Ex parte Miles, supra, The rationale\\nfor granting mandamus in that case was\\nthat the stockholders were being denied “a\\nclear legal right, the allowance of which is\\na matter of peremptory duty, and not of\\njudicial discretion,” citing Ex parte Wat-\\nters, 180 Ala. 523, 61 So. 904 (1913), and\\nEx parte Weissinger, 247 Ala. 113, 22 So.\\n2d 510 (1945).3\\n\\nGranting mandamus, says the Bank, on\\nthe issue of inspection operates to preclude\\nthe instant appeal under Rule 54(b). The\\nBank contends, by granting mandamus, this\\nCourt acknowledged that the entire case\\nhad not been fully adjudicated below;\\ntherefore, the appeal on the penalty is an\\nappeal from a nonfinal judgment; and,\\nwithout the express direction for entry of\\njudgment under Rule 54(b), it is due to be\\ndismissed. We disagree.\\n\\nOur holding that mandamus was proper\\nin Ex parte Miles, supra, did not necessari-\\n\\nbama Gas Corporation v. Morrow, 265 Ala.\\n604, 93 So.2d 515 (1957), and Loveman v.\\nTutwiler Inv. Co, 240 Ala. 424, 199 So. 854\\n(1941).\\n\\n\\n290\\n\\nly mean that appeal was not also available.\\nIt only meant that appeal was not adequate\\nbecause of the exigencies of the situation\\nand because of the peremptory, nondiscre-\\ntionary duty violated by the trial Judge.\\nTo determine whether appeal is proper in\\nthe instant case, it is necessary to deter-\\nmine whether the trial Judge’s order, in all\\nits component parts, was appealable when\\nhe entered it. If it were appealable at that\\ntime, then the “express determination” and\\n“express direction” requirements of Rule\\n54(b) are unnecessary. Cates v. Bush, su-~\\npra,\\n\\nWe hold that the trial Judge’s order ap-\\npointing a Master to determine which rec-~\\nords the stockholders could properly inspect\\nis a final judgment for purposes of appeal;\\ntherefore, the summary judgment on the\\npenalty is not a partial judgment and it is\\nappealable without a Rule 54(b) determina-\\ntion and direction.\\n\\nA large body of case law has developed\\naround the problem of when an order\\nwhich refers part of a case to a register or\\nmaster is a final judgment. Chadwick v.\\nTown of Hammondville, 270 Ala. 618, 120\\nSo,2d 899 (1960). The first Alabama cas-\\nes on the problem are now over 130 years\\nold and their rules have been followed con-\\nsistently. The earliest statement is “that a\\ndecree ‘is final when it ascertains all the\\nrights of the parties in litigation, although\\nthere may be a reference to the master to\\nascertain facts for an account between the\\nparties.” Bank of Mobile v. Hall, 6 Ala.\\n141 (1844), and Weatherford v. James, 2\\nAla. 170 (1841).\\n\\nThe rule arose in equity jurisprudence\\nbecause old Equity Rules 79 through 88\\nwere the only effective vehicle for appoint-\\ning masters prior to the adoption of the\\nAlabama Rules of Civil Procédure. As the\\nequity rule developed, it was broadened to\\napply to various equity situations. The\\nmost common statement is, “The test’ of\\nthe finality of a decree sufficient to sup-\\nport an appeal is that it ascertains and de-\\nclares the rights of the parties and settles\\n\\nthe equities, and is not controlled by the\\nfact that the cause remains in fieri in re-\\nspect to other matters.” McCulloch v.\\nRoberts, 290 Ala. 303, 276 So.2d 425\\n(1973); Moorer v. Chastang, 247 Ala. 676,\\n26 So.2d 75 (1946); Carter v. Mitchell,\\n225 Ala. 287, 142 So. 514 (1932).\\n\\nARCP 53 has now superseded old Equity\\nRules 79 through 88, and ARCP 2 has\\nmerged the procedural distinction between\\nlaw and equity into one:form of action—\\nthe “civil action”. Rule 53 provides for\\nreference to a master in any civil action in\\nwhich the presiding judge finds it neces-\\nsary. It is now incumbent upon this Court\\nto determine whether the equity case law\\nallowing appeal after a reference to master\\nshould be extended to the Rule 53 situa-\\ntion. The rationale for the equity rule was\\narticulated in one of the early cases. That\\nrationale is: If the chancellor has erro-\\nneously ascertained the merits of the case,\\nthe delay, expense, and trouble attending\\nthe ascertainment of facts and preparation\\nof a report by the master are unnecessary\\nand profitless. Bank of Mobile v. Hall,\\nsupra.\\n\\nWe find that the policy articulated by\\nthis Court in Bank of Mobile case is as ap-\\nplicable today as it was in 1844. Rule\\n53(a) provides that “the compensation to\\nbe allowed to a master shall be fixed by\\nthe court, and shall be charged upon such\\nof the parties . . . as the court may\\ndirect.” In the instant case, the Court or-\\ndered the Bank of Heflin, Miles, and the\\nWoods to pay $400 each to defray expens-\\nes of the Master. If it is determined that\\nthe trial Judge adjudicated all of the merits\\nof the case, and the stockholders were\\ngoing to appeal regardless of the content\\nof the Master’s report, it would be “unnec-\\nessary and profitless” for them to await\\nthe Master’s report before appealing. This\\nis the same situation this Court faced when\\nappeals were brought from equity trials\\nafter reference to a master and the same\\nrule must apply here.\\n\\n\\n291\\n\\nHI We now address the question of\\nwhether the instant case falls within the\\nscope of the rule allowing appeal from or-\\nders which include references to masters,\\nThe purpose of this inquiry, it must be re-\\nmembered, is not to determine the proprie-\\nty of our granting mandamus in Ex parte\\nMiles, supra, but rather, it is to determine\\nwhether the trial Judge’s order constituted\\na final judgment in all of the claims, there-\\nby taking this case beyond the scope of\\nRule 54(b). The mere fact that the Court\\nhas ordered a reference to a Master is not,\\nof itself, sufficient to make out ‘a final\\njudgment for purposes of appeal. It is\\nalso necessary that the trial Judge has de-\\ncided “the substantial merits of the contro-\\nversy—the material issues of fact and law\\nlitigated or necessarily involved in the\\ncause, which determine the legal rights of\\nthe parties, and the principles by which\\nsuch rights are to be worked out.” Adams\\nv. Sayre, 76 Ala, 509 (1884).\\n\\n[In the instant case, we can deter-\\nmine what material issues of fact and law\\nare involved in the controversy from the\\npleadings of the parties. The Bank’s com-\\nplaint prayed that the Court set forth in\\ndetail the books, records of account, memo-\\nranda, and other information that the\\nstockholders were entitled to see, but that\\nit deny the stockholders access to confiden-\\ntial information and information held by\\nthe Bank in its fiduciary relationship with\\nits customers, The stockholders’ answer\\ndenied that the Bank had a right to with-\\nhold any records from stockholder inspec-\\ntion based on its claim of confidential rela-\\ntidnship and prayed that the Court direct\\nthe Bank to immediately make available all\\nof its books and records of account for\\ntheir examination.\\n\\nIn its order, the Court found:\\n\\n(1) That the Bank’s fiduciary relation-\\nship and duty to its customers did\\nplace limitations upon the access to\\nall writings or records of the Bank.\\n\\n(2) That the stockholders could not have\\naccess to the individual files and\\nmemoranda from which the books\\nand records are prepared,\\n\\nThat the Bank should not reveal\\nsuch things as amount on deposit or\\nsavings of customers, individual cer-\\ntificates of deposit, and private\\nmemoranda of customers.\\n\\n(3.\\n\\nAfter making these findings, the Court re-\\nferred the matter to a Special Master who\\nwas directed to return a report specifying\\nwhich of the Bank’s records did not fall\\nwithin the category of confidential infor-\\nmation and were, therefore, available for\\ninspection.\\n\\nWhen the Court made its findings and\\nissued its decree in accordance therewith,\\nincluding reference to the Master, it adju-\\ndicated the substantial merits of the con-\\ntroversey. It granted the Bank’s request\\n\\n+ to limit the inspection and denied the\\n\\nstockholders’ demand for complete inspec-\\ntion, All that remained was for a Master\\nto determine exactly which of the Bank’s\\nrecords fell within the prohibited category.\\nRegardless of what the Master reported, he\\ncould not have broadened, or otherwise en-\\nlarged upon, the limited right of inspection\\nas decreed by the Court. Thus, the stock-\\nholders lost their case on the merits and\\ntheir right of appeal necessarily accrued at\\nthat time. Indeed, had the stockholders\\nawaited the Master’s report, they would\\nhave risked the running of the statutory\\nperiod for appeal. O’Rear v. O’Rear, 227\\nAla. 403, 150 So, 502 (1933).\\n\\nThis situation falls exactly within the\\npolicy behind allowing appeals, under cer-\\ntain circumstances, from reference to mas-\\nters. We find that it would have been\\n“unnecessary and profitless” for the stock-\\nholders to have awaited the Master’s re-\\nport to appeal; and we hold that, under\\nthe adjudication of substantial merits rule\\nset out in McCulloch, the order appointing\\nthe Master was final and would have sup-\\n\\n292\\n\\nported an appeal. Therefore, the stock-\\nholders’ appeal from the summary judg-\\nment entered against their counterclaim\\nfor the statutory penalty is not an appeal\\nfrom a nonfinal judgment and it is not due\\nto be dismissed. Motion to dismiss the ap-\\npeal is denied,\\n\\nI\\n\\nOn the Merits of the Appeal\\n\\nThe trial Judge granted the summary\\njudgment and dismissed the stockholders’\\ncounterclaim because he found that “the\\nfiling of the declaratory judgment action\\ndoes not constitute a refusal or denial of\\nthe, records.” Our review of the trial\\nCourt’s order granting a motion for sum-\\nmary judgment requires us ‘to address two\\nissues.\\n\\nFirst, whether the trial Judge’s decision\\nis legally correct. Second, whether affida-\\nvits and depositions of the parties show\\nthere was no genuine issue of material fact\\nas required by Rule 56(c).\\n\\nHl On the first issue, we must decide\\nwhether a declaratory judgment filed by a\\ncorporation to limit stockholders’ inspec-\\ntion of corporate records is a “refusal” of\\nthe stockholders’ demand as a matter of\\nlaw. The purpose of the statutory penalty\\nis to make corporate records more accessi-\\nble to stockholders. If there were no pen-\\nalty, the usual course for a stockholder\\nseeking inspection would be to file suit to\\nenforce his right. The expense of such lit-\\nigation would discourage many stockhold-\\ners from pursuing their rights. The penal-\\nty forces a corporation to assume financial\\nresponsibility for its refusal.\\n\\nIf we were to hold that filing of declar-\\natory judgment action was not a refusal as\\na matter of law, then the Board of Direc-\\ntors can easily circumvent the penalty pro-\\n\\n2. For an in depth discussion of the objective\\ntest applicable to the statutory requirements\\nthat the examination of the books and records\\nby a stockholder be for a “proper purpose”\\n\\nvision while still putting the stockholders\\nto the expense of litigation to enforce their\\ninspection rights. By rendering the penal-\\nty provision, inoperative, declaratory judg-\\nment actions would shield the Board from\\nthe demands of those stockholders who\\ncannot afford to pursue litigation.\\n\\nTherefore, we cannot agree that filing a\\ndeclaratory judgment action is not a refus-\\nal to allow inspection. The fact that the\\nBoard of Directors, rather than the stock-\\nholders, has instituted the litigation cannot\\nexonerate the Board of its duty to allow\\ninspection, We therefore hold that .when\\nthe Board forced the stockholders to liti-\\ngate in order to pursue their rights, it ef-\\nfectively refused to allow inspection.\\n\\nThe remaining issue for liability under\\nthe penalty statute is whether the Bank’s\\nrefusal to allow full inspection of its books\\nand records was “without reasonable\\ncause.” Tit. 10, § 21 (46). Ordinarily,\\nthis question of reasonable cause is a dis-\\nputed factual issue to be determined with\\nreference to the facts and circumstances in\\neach case As the Committe Comments\\nto Rule 56 state: “The summary judgment\\nprocedure is not a substitute for the trial\\nof disputed issues of fact. On a motion\\nfor summary judgment, the court cannot\\ntry issues of fact.” 10 Wright and Miller,\\nFederal Practice and Procedure, § 2712,\\n\\nThe posture of the record in the instant\\n\\n.case, however, reveals an out of the ordi-\\n\\nnary situation. Following responsive\\npleadings, including counterclaims for the\\nstatutory penalty, filed by the stockholders\\nto the Bank’s Bill for Declaratory Judg-\\nment, each of the parties, with supportive\\naffidavits and depositions, moved the Court\\nfor summary judgment. Understandably,\\nwhen the trial Court denied the stock-\\nholders the right of full inspection, it\\nlikewise denied their motions for summary\\n\\nand that the, penalty be imposed for an of-\\nficer’s refusal of such examination “without\\nreasonable cause”, see Smith v. Flynn, 275\\nAla, 892, 155 So.2d 497 (1963).\\n\\n\\n293\\n\\njudgment and, consistent therewith, grant-\\ned the Bank’s motion for summary judg-\\nment. This had the effect of dismissing\\nthe stockholders’ counterclaims.\\n\\nUnquestionably, had the trial Court de-\\nnied the Bank’s sought for relief limiting\\nthe stockholders’ right of full inspection, it\\nlikewise would have denied the Bank’s mo-\\ntion for summary judgment. Ex parte\\nMiles, supra, revised the trial Court’s order\\ndenying full inspection on the basis of the\\nclear and nondiscretionary mandate of the\\n\\n* statute. Moreover, the right of a stock-\\nholder, within reasonable limits and for\\nproper purposes, to inspect the books and\\nrecords of the corporation in which he\\nowns an interest, absent a contract to the\\ncontrary, is hardly dependent upon legisla-\\ntive expression. Indeed, any effort to stat-\\nutorily limit such right by arbitrarily ex-\\ncluding certain books and records from the\\nscope of full inspection would raise serious\\nconstitutional questions.\\n\\nGiven the revision of the trial Court’s\\norder denying full inspection affected by\\nEx parte Miles, and given our ‘conclusion\\nthat in the context here presented the\\nBank’s filing of a declaratory judgment ac-\\ntion was an effective denial of the stock-\\nholders’ request for such inspection, we\\nnecessarily must reverse the order below\\ngranting the Bank’s motion for summary\\njudgment and dismissing the stockholders’\\ncounterclaims. This is not to say that the\\nBank’s mere filing of a declaratory judg-\\nment action in itself is an effective denial\\nof the right of inspection. Rather, we say\\nthat the basis for the denial was the de-\\nfense of confidentiality and upon that basis\\nthere was an effective denial of the right\\nof inspection resulting in the right to re-\\ncover the statutory penalty under Tit. 10, §\\n21(46).\\n\\nThe only basis for the Bank’s refusal is\\nsummed up in its President’s deposition\\nwhen he states that the Bank’s confidential\\nrelationship with its customers made a de-\\nclaratory judgment action reasonable, and\\n\\nthus its refusal was with reasonable cause.\\nSince this constitutes a legal contention\\nmerely, which has been rejected by Ex\\nparte Miles and the instant appeal, the trial\\nCourt is directed on remand to grant the\\nstockholders’ motions for summary judg-\\nment and assess against the Bank in favor\\nof each stockholder respondent a penalty\\nequal to 10% of the value of the stock\\nowned by each respective stockholder.\\n\\nReversed and remanded with instruc-\\ntions. .\\n\\nMERRILL, BLOODWORTH, MAD-\\nDOX, FAULKNER, ALMON and EM-\\nBRY, JJ., concur.\\n\\nSHORES, J., concurs specially.\\nHEFLIN, C. J.,, not sitting.\\n\\nSHORES, Justice (concurring special-\\nly):\\n\\nI agree with the result and agree that\\nRule 54(b), ARCP, has no application\\nsince, in my view, the order entered by the\\ntrial court, granting the bank’s motion for\\nsummary judgment and limiting the appel-\\nlants’ right to full inspection, was a judg-\\nment which was final and therefore ap-\\npealable.\\n\\nAs to these appellants, stockholders, the\\nruling of the trial court could not have\\nbeen more adverse, nor final. The ruling\\ndenied every aspect of relief which they\\nsought without reservation. It was their\\ncontention that they were entitled to\\nfull inspection of the records of the bank.\\nThe appointment of a master to select\\nwhat parts of those records could be in-\\nspected was, as far as the stockholders\\nwere concerned, a denial of their claim of\\nright to inspect all of the records. Re-\\ngardless of what the master produced, it\\nwould necessarily be less than they sought\\nto inspect. Therefore, I think appeal was\\nproper and that the method of review\\nshould have been utilized to test the pro-\\n\\n\\n294\\n\\npriety of the trial court’s refusal to permit\\nfull inspection of the records. The fact\\nthat the court has granted a petition for\\nwrit of maridamus, as to the right to in-\\nspect, does not destroy the finality of the\\njudgment entered and appealed from here,\\nbut candor requires us to admit that piece-\\nmeal review has been the result.\\n\\nOn Rehearing\\n\\nThis Court notes that the Bank has re-\\ntained new counsel who has filed an exten-\\nsive brief in support of its application for\\nrehearing. For that reason, we feel con-\\nstrained to file an extended written opin-\\nion, addressing the important points raised\\nin the application.\\n\\nThe arguments urging our modification\\nof the original opinion fall into three cate-\\ngories:\\n\\n1, The trial Court did not consider\\nthe stockholders’ motion for summary\\njudgment on their counterclaim for\\nthe penalty; therefore, the issue was\\nnot before this Court for review.\\n\\n2. Regardless of whether the trial\\nCourt considered the stockholders’\\nmotion, this Court erroneously re-\\nmanded the cause with instructions\\nto enter a summary judgment in fa-\\nvor of the stockholders because the\\nquestions of the stockholders’ “prop-\\ner purpose” and the Bank’s “reasona-\\nble cause” for refusal are issues for\\ntrial, and because the stockholders\\ndid not assign as error the trial\\nJudge’s denial of their motion for\\nsummary judgment.\\n\\n3. The 10% penalty prescribed by Title\\n10, § 21(46), is a maximum figure,\\nnot an absolute standard; therefore,\\nthe trial Court is authorized to set\\nthe penalty on a continuum up to\\n10%.\\n\\nWee will address each of these arguments\\nseparately.\\n\\nFirst, the record sets out the stockhold-\\ners’ motion for summary judgment on their\\ncounterclaim for the penalty. The motion\\nis accompanied by affidavits which include\\nthe stockholders’ letters to the Bank de-\\nmanding inspection of books and records\\nand the depositions of the Bank’s stock-\\nholders, president, attorney, and public re-\\nlations officer. The trial Judge’s order is\\nprefaced with the following statement:\\n“This is a declaratory judgment and is\\nsubmitted on motions by the respective\\nparties for a summary judgment on the\\npleadings, affidavits and depositions on file\\nin this case.” There is no order in the rec-\\nord striking the stockholders’ motion for\\nsummary judgment and whether the trial\\nJudge, in fact, did consider the motion is\\nnot material to this Court’s review of the\\ntrial Court’s propriety in not granting it.\\n\\nHHI Where the parties have moved for\\nsummary judgment under Rule 56 and sub-\\nmitted supporting affidavits, which estab-\\nlish that there is no genuine issue of mate-\\nrial fact, appellate courts are authorized to\\nremand the case with instructions for entry\\nof summary judgment. Sayre v. City of\\nCleveland, 493 F.2d 64 (6th Cir. 1974).\\nWe therefore find no merit in the Bank’s\\nfirst argument.\\n\\nThe Bank’s second argument is\\nthat determinations of “proper purpose”\\nand “reasonable cause” were genuine issues\\nof material fact. Smith v. Flynn, 275 Ala.\\n392, 155 So.2d 497 (1963), explains that\\nthe burden is on a corporation to ‘prove im-\\nproper purpose; therefore, if the corpora-\\ntion does not question the stockholders’\\npurposes, there is no issue for trial. The\\nstockholders’ demand for inspection alleged\\nproper purposes such as inquiries into:\\nmisuse of corporate funds, the abuse of\\ncorporate office, the diversion of corporate\\nassets to the personal benefit of any offi-\\ncer, director, employee or stockholder, and\\nthe favoring of certain customers of the\\nBank because of their personal connections\\nwith the officers or directors. The deposi-\\n\\n\\n295\\n\\ntions of the stockholders which accompa-\\nnied their motion for summary judgment\\nset forth specific occurrences which made\\nthem suspect corporate mismanagement.\\nTwo examples of the suspected misman-\\nagement were the Bank’s purchasing land\\nfrom a board member at more than its\\n\\nmarket value and the Bank’s making.a sub-*\\n\\nstantial loan to a board member who could\\noffer only a second mortgage as security.\\n\\nThe Bank offered no affidavits to estab-\\nlish improper purpose. Rule 56(e), in per-\\ntinent part, provides:\\n\\n“When a motion for summary judg-\\nment is made and supported as provided\\nin this rule, an adverse party may not\\nrest upon the mere allegations or denials\\nof his pleadings, but his response, by af-\\nfidavits or as otherwise provided in this\\nrule, must set forth specific facts show-\\ning that there is a genuine issue for\\ntrial. If he does not so respond, summa-\\n\\n“ry judgment, if appropriate, shall be en-\\n\\ntered against him.”\\n\\nThe last sentence of 56(e) has been in-\\nterpreted to mean that even if the adverse\\nparty files no affidavits opposing the mo-\\ntion, a summary judgment can be entered\\nagainst him only if “appropriate.” Dawk-\\nins v. Green, 412 F.2d 644 (5th Cir. 1969).\\nWe hold that this is an appropriate case\\nfor the entry of summary judgment for\\ntwo reasons. First, the president of the\\nBank on direct examination by the stock-\\nholders’ attorney admitted that he had no\\nreason to believe that Mr. Miles had some\\npurpose for asking to see the records other\\nthan to determine the way the bank had\\nbeen operated. Second, the burden is on\\nthe corporation to prove that the stock-\\nholders’ demand is not for a proper pur-\\npose. Smith v. Flynn, supra, Therefore,\\nif the Bank offers no evidence of improper\\npurpose and in fact admits through its\\npresident that there is no reason to suspect\\nimproper purpose, the question of purpose\\nis not an issue for trial.\\n\\nOn the “reasonable cause” issue, again,\\n\\n‘the burden rests with ‘the corporation.\\n\\nThe trial Judge found that the peculiar fi-\\nduciary relationship between a Bank and\\nits customers created a reasonable cause\\nfor the Bank’s refusal to permit inspection.\\nThis Court, however, reversed that finding\\nin Ex parte Miles, 294 Ala. 462, 318 So.2d\\n697 (1975), holding that the inspection\\nrights of stockholders of a bank are the\\nsame as stockholders of a corporation gen-\\nerally, Thus, Ex parte Miles finally re-\\nsolved the question of “reasonable cause”,\\nand that issue is not before the trial Court\\non remand. Since all of the triable issues\\n—issues of law, not of fact—are resolved\\nin this Court, the only proceeding remain-\\n\\n“ing for the trial Court is to grant a sum-\\n\\nmary judgment in favor of the stockhold-\\ners, Millworth Converting Corp. v. Slifka,\\n188 F.Supp. 629 (S.D.N.Y.1960).\\n\\nTl As to the propriety of our instruc-\\ntions to grant a summary judgment, the\\nBank argues that the issue of the trial\\nJudge’s denial was not before this Court\\non appeal because it was not assigned as\\nerror. Our instruction, however, is not\\ngrounded upon a reversal of the trial\\nJudge’s erroneous denial of the stockhold-\\ners’ motion for summary judgment. Rath-\\ner, our instruction is an acknowledgement\\nthat the trial Judge correctly found that\\nthere were no triable issues. Our authori-\\nty for the instruction is not the rules of\\nappellate procedure, as the Bank assumes,\\nbut rather the mandate of Rule 1 of\\nARCP. Rule 1 requires that the rules\\n“shall be construed to secure the just,\\nspeedy and inexpensive determination of\\nevery action.” Since the material issues of\\nthis case have been disposed of by the affi-\\ndavits of the parties, by Ex parte Miles,\\nand by our original opinion, a trial is un-\\nnecessary.\\n\\nThis situation falls squarely within the\\npurpose of Rule 56 to “improve the ma-\\nchinery of justice, promote the expeditious\\ndisposition of cases, and avoid unnecessary\\ntrials where no genuine issues of fact are\\n\\n\\n296 —\\n\\nraised.” 10 Wright and Miller, Federal\\nPractice and Procedure, § 2712 (1973).\\nWhere there are no triable issues of fact,\\nas here found by the trial Court and with\\nwhich finding we agree, and the legal issue\\npresented has been resolved against the\\nBank, our mandate on reversal for the en-\\ntering of a summary judgment in favor of\\nthe stockholders necessarily follows,\\n\\nI Finally, the Bank takes issue with\\nthe latter portion of the last sentence of\\nour original opinion: “. . and assess\\nagainst the Bank in favor of each stock-\\nholder respondent a penalty equal to 10%\\nof the value of the stock owned by each\\nrespective stockholder.” Of the three\\npoints raised, the first two were treated, at\\nleast to some degree, in the original opin-\\nion. While, in deference to counsel’s ear-\\nnest insistance, we have not considered the\\nfirst two points lightly, it is this 10% pen-\\nalty issue—treated only summarily in the\\noriginal opinion—to which we have devot-\\ned the most time and effort in our consid-\\neration of this cause on rehearing,\\n\\nWe find ourselves in substantial agree-\\nment with the policy arguments advanced\\nby counsel for the Bank that the penalty\\nshould be up to 10% with guidelines for\\nthe discretionary fixing of the amount ac-\\ncording to the gravity and circumstances\\nof the wrong for which the penalty is im-\\nposed, To eliminate all discretion and re-\\nquire the imposition of the penalty by an\\nabsolute standard, says counsel for the\\nBank, treats all refusals to allow inspection\\nof corporate books and records, not sus-\\ntained on “improper purpose” grounds, as\\nequal in degree and severity. It would\\nfurther encourage refusal to a relatively\\nsmall stockholder as opposed to the request\\nof a large stockholder where the risk ‘of\\nrefusal would prohibit a contest even in le-\\ngitimate “improper purpose” cases, Our\\nprerogatives on appellate review, however,\\ndo not extend to policy making but rather\\nto judicially interpreting the legislative\\n\\n. policy,\\n\\nThe primary authority cited by the Bank\\nin support of its proposition that the penal-\\nty statute should be interpreted as a maxi-\\nmum rather than an absolute standard is\\nthe case of McCormick v. Statler Hotels\\nDelaware Corporation, 55 Iil.App2d 21,\\n203 N.E.2d 697 (1964), In upholding a\\npenalty award of less than 10% under an\\nidentical statute, this intermediate appellate\\ncourt observed:\\n\\n«\\n\\n. . . the statute says an officer or\\ncorporation, ‘. . shall be liable\\n\\n. ina penalty of ten per cent of\\nthe value of the shares owned by such\\nstockholder. . . .? The question\\nhere is the meaning of ‘shal! be liable.’\\n“, . . The [Illinois] Supreme Court\\nsaid in that case [People v. Elgin Home\\nProtective Ass\\'n, 359 IN, 379, 194 N.E.\\n584 (1935)], ‘The words “may” and\\n“shall,” when used in a statute, will\\nsometimes be read interchangeably, as\\nwill best express the legislative intent.’\\nOn this basis, it is possible for us to find\\nthat the imposition of a penalty rests in\\nthe discretion of the Court below.\\n\\n“We can reach this same result\\nthrough interpreting the word ‘liable’\\nBeing liable for a ten per cent penalty\\ncould mean the defendants are subject to\\na fine up to ten per cent of the value of\\nthe stock ”\\n\\nWe cannot accept either basis for inter-\\npreting “shall be liable . . . ina pen-\\nalty of ten per cent . . .” as permit-\\nting a discretionary penalty imposition not\\nto exceed 10%. The interchangeability of\\n“may” and “shall” to effect legislative in-\\ntent is a sound rule; but it can be given a\\nfield of operation only where the overall\\nexpression of the legislative enactment evi-\\ndences an intent and purpose contrary to\\nthe term employed. See Morgan v. State,\\n280 Ala. 414, 194 So.2d 820 (1967). Here,\\nno contrary intent which permits “may” to\\nbe substituted for “shall” is manifest.\\n\\nPerhaps the word “liable” could be inter-\\npreted as subject to a fine up to 10% (one\\n\\n\\nof its secondary meanings being “likely\\n‘to”) except that it is preceded by the\\nwords “shall be.” To be subject to a “like-\\nly’ to” connotation, the sentence would\\nread, “A corporation is liable to a fine of\\n10%.” This interpretation is precluded,\\nhowever, by the phrase “shall be liable\\n\\n. ina penalty of 10%,” particularly\\nwhere this is the only expression of legis-\\nlative intent and its mandatory imposition\\nis in harmony with the overall spirit of the\\n“right of stockholders to inspect corporate\\nrecords” statute.\\n\\nOpinion extended and application for re-\\nhearing overruled,\\n\\nAll the Justices concur, except HEFLIN,\\nC.

Robinson, filed a\\nsuit in circuit court against Leroy Brown,\\nindividually and in his capacity as Super-\\nintendent of Education of the State of\\nAlabama. She asked for a declaratory\\njudgment concerning Dr. Brown’s responsi-\\nbilities to her, as a non-tenured teacher,\\nunder the obligatory duties of his office\\ndefined constitutionally, statutorily and ad-\\nministratively. The trial court dismissed\\nthe case. We affirm.\\n\\nA background statement is necessary to a\\nclear understanding of this case. Ms, Rob-\\ninson taught for one year in the Jefferson\\nCounty School System. She was not ten-\\nured and her contract of employment was\\nterminated after that year. She filed suit\\nin the United States District Court for the\\nNorthern District of Alabama under 42\\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the Jefferson\\nCounty Board of Education’s refusal to re-\\nnew her contract was unconstitutional be-\\ncause it (1) denied her a right to a hearing\\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment and (2)\\nwas taken in retaliation for her exercise of\\nprotected First Amendment rights. The\\ndistrict court granted Brown’s motion for\\nsummary judgment on the first claim and a\\n\\nnonjury trial on the second claim. The\\ndistrict judge found that the board’s action\\nwas taken for constitutionally permissible\\nreasons. The Fifth Ciricuit affirmed at 485\\nF.2d 1381, reh. den. en banc, 488 F.2d 1055\\n(1973). The United State Supreme Court\\ndenied certiorari, 419 U.S. 862, 95 S.Ct. 115,\\n42 L.Ed.2d 97, The reasons given for the\\ndismissal are stated in 485 F.2d 1381.\\n\\nMs. Robinson admitted in oral argument\\nthat she brought suit against Brown—or as\\nshe phrased it: “got a new defendant”—\\nin order to circumvent a defense of res\\njudicata or estoppel. The fact that her\\n“new defendant” was the State Superin-\\ntendent of Education adds no strength to\\nher case. Had she sued the Jefferson\\nCounty Board of Education in this state\\nsuit, all the essential elements of judgment\\nby estoppel or res judicata would have been\\npresent and the principle that matters once\\nadjudicated are settled and determined\\nwould apply.

Tit. 52, § 86, Code\\n1940,\\n\\nHE The thrust of Ms. Robinson’s claim\\nis that she was discharged without cause.\\nShe chose the federal forum and she went\\nthrough the District Court, the Fifth Cir-\\ncuit Court of Appeals and applied for cer-\\ntiorari to the Supreme Court of the United\\nStates, where it was denied. She then\\nstarted the same suit with the same subject\\nmatter and the same issues in State Cir-\\ncuit Court with the exception that she had\\na new defendant who had no duty or re-\\nsponsibility in her suit.\\n\\n\\nIn the federal case, the defendant was\\nthe Jefferson County Board of Education,\\nthe only body in Alabama which had the\\npower to employ Ms, Robinson in the\\nteaching position she held, and the only\\nbody which could discharge her.

Some background\\ninformation is necessary to place the in-\\nstant case in proper perspective.\\n\\nOur records reveal that the State of\\nAlabama, in April, 1972, filed a complaint\\nin the Circuit Court of Jefferson County\\nagainst Empire requesting that the company\\nbe placed in receivership because it was\\nimpaired and insolvent. Thereafter, fol-\\nlowing a hearing before Judge William C.\\nBarber, Empire was placed in receivership\\nby an order dated June 29, 1972, and John\\n.G. Bookout, the Commissioner of Insur-\\nance for the State of Alabama, was named\\nreceiver. Bookout was succeeded as com-\\nmissioner by Charles H. Payne on January\\n20, 1975, Empire was also placed in re-\\nceivership in the States of Arkansas, Mon-\\ntana and Texas with ancillary receivers\\nappointed in those states. No appeal was\\ntaken by Empire or any of its officers\\nfrom the decision placing it in receiver-\\nship.\\n\\nIn May, 1973, the receiver petitioned the\\nreceivership court for instructions on seek-\\ning approval of the various federal and\\nstate regulatory agencies for possible ad-\\nvertisement for bids for complete reinsur-\\nance of the business of Empire to protect\\nthe policyholders. This order was granted.\\nFollowing the approval of the Federal\\nTrade Commission, the Securities Exchange\\nCommission and state regulatory agencies,\\nthe receiver, on request of commissioners\\nand receivers of other interested states,\\nfiled a petition for instructions regarding\\nreinsurance, asking the circuit court to enter\\nan order permitting the receiver to adver-\\n\\n\\n302\\n\\ntise for and secure bids for the complete\\nreinsurance of all of the business of Empire.\\nThis order was granted.\\n\\nFollowing advertisement in various me-\\ndia, bids were taken in compliance with\\norders of the court. Bids were submitted\\nby Protective Life Insurance Company\\n{hereinafter Protective] and two other life\\ninsurance companies in addition to a bid\\nsubmitted by Shearn Moody, Jr., of Texas,\\nPresident, Chairman of the Board and prin-\\ncipal stockholder of Empire. Another bid\\nwas submitted by an individual. Follow-\\ning a hearing of all bidders before the\\ninterested commissioners and receivers of\\nthe various states, the bid of Protective was\\nrecommended to the court in a petition filed\\nin January, 1974, for liquidation and rein-\\nsurance without dissolution under provi-\\nsions of the Alabama Insurance Code, Act\\nNo. 407, § 624, Acts of Alabama 1971, p.\\n996, listed in the Recompilation as Tit. 28A,\\n§ 624(2), on the grounds that further ef-\\nforts to rehabilitate the company would be\\nuseless,\\n\\nMoody objected to the reinsurance and\\nliquidation of Empire and was granted the\\nright to intervene.\\n\\nDuring the course of the three-week\\nhearing, Protective was also made a party\\nfor intervention. Following extensive hear-\\ning and briefing by all parties, the trial\\ncourt, on June 14, 1974, entered an order\\ngranting the receiver’s petition to liquidate\\nand reinsure the business of Empire into\\nProtective. The trial court found, inter\\nalia, that Empire was impaired in excess\\nof ten million dollars, insolvent in excess\\nof six million dollars and that the financial\\ncondition of Empire was “rapidly deterio-\\nrating.”\\n\\nIntervenor Moody gave notice of appeal,\\nfiled a motion for supersedeas bond and\\nmotion for new trial, These motions were\\noverruled. The appeal was taken on July\\n25, 1974; the certificate of appeal was re-\\nceived in this court on August 6, 1974, but\\nthe transcript of the record has not yet\\n\\nbeen received. We avert to this later in\\nthe opinion.\\n\\nI, The Injunction.\\n\\nOn December 27, 1974, John G. Bookout,\\nthe Commissioner of Insurance for the\\nState of Alabama, applied for and received\\na temporary restraining order against\\nMoody and others. The order prevented\\nthe filing, sponsoring or aiding of any law-\\nsuit or legal claim relating to the affairs\\nof Empire, the treaty of assumption and\\nbulk reinsurance or the decree approving\\nthe treaty. To supplement his application,\\nBookout attached affidavits concerning\\nthe multiplicity of litigation instituted\\nby Moody, threats by him to institute fur-\\nther litigation, and the deposition of one\\nWillie Allmon. The hearing was set for\\nJanuary 6, 1975.\\n\\nCommissioner Bookout testified at the\\nhearing; there was no objection to his\\ntestimony, and there was no cross-examina-\\ntion. His. testimony is, therefore, uncon-\\ntroverted and undisputed. He testified that\\nhe has been subjected (both as receiver of\\nEmpire and individually) to numerous law-\\nsuits and proceedings filed by Moody or\\nMoody lawyers, all of which related to the\\nEmpire receivership and all of which were\\nfiled subsequent to the plenary hearing con-\\nducted by the receivership court in April,\\n1974, which culminated in the June 14, 1974\\norder determining that Empire was insol-\\nvent and that reinsurance of the Empire\\npolicies was necessary to protect the in-\\nterests of policyholders. He also testified\\nas to the following separate lawsuits or\\nproceedings filed by Moody or Moody\\'s\\nlawyers and, as to each of them, Bookout\\ntestified that said litigation substantially\\ndepleted the assets of the receivership es-\\ntate and, further, resulted in irreparable\\nloss to the receivership in terms of serious-\\nly interfering with implementation of the\\nreceivership court’s orders and supervision\\nof the receivership by Bookout: °\\n\\n\\n303\\n\\nA. Moody v. Empire, No. 112,034, a\\n\\n- suit filed in state court, Galveston County,\\nTexas, in which Moody sought to prevent\\nthe transfer of the principal asset of\\nEmpire to Protective.\\n\\nB. Meyers v. Moody, C.A, 3-5678-D,\\na suit pending in federal court, Northern\\nDistrict of Texas, in which Moody filed\\na cross -action against Bookout as receiver\\nof Empire and individually. Moody’s cross\\naction alleged misinanagement of the re-\\nceivership estate by Bookout and alleged\\nthat Bookout put Empire in receivership for\\npolitical reasons. [The issues raised by\\nMoody’s cross action had been fully liti-\\ngated and decided adversely to Moody in\\nthe April, 1974 hearing before the Alabama\\nReceivership Court.]\\n\\nC. Extraordinary proceedings in this\\ncourt and one federal suit:\\n\\n(1) In Ex parte Moody, S.C. 962, Moody\\nsought that this court approve a super-\\nsedeas bond pending his appeal from the\\nJune 14 decree; in the alternative, Moody\\nsought the issuance of a writ of mandamus\\nto compel the receivership court to permit\\nsupersedeas, All relief sought by Moody\\nwas denied.\\n\\n(2) Moody then filed Moody v. Bookout, ©\\n\\nCiv. No. 74-328-N, in which Moody sought\\nfederal district court review of the fore-\\ngoing decisions of this court, ostensibly on\\nconstitutional grounds. The Federal Dis-\\ntrict Court for the Middle District of Ala-\\nbama summarily dismissed said action on\\nthe grounds that Moody was pursuing the\\nmatter in the state courts of Alabama.\\n\\n(3) Moody nevertheless filed Moody v.\\nBookout, S.C. 1032, in which Moody at-\\ntempted, for the fourth time, to relitigate\\nthe denial of supersedeas in connection\\nwith his appeal from the June 14, 1974\\ndecree. This attempt was also rejected by\\nthis court.\\n\\nD. Allmon v. Bookout, Civ. No, 74-377-\\nN, was filed in the name of Willie Allmon,\\nan Arkansas policyholder of Empire. This\\nsuit alleged that Bookout and Protective\\n\\ncaused Allmon to lose 35% of the cash\\nvalue of his policy. Bookout testified that\\nthe records of Empire affirmatively show\\nthat the cash-value position of the Allmon\\npolicy was unaffected by the receivership\\nof Empire or by the reinsurance of Empire’s\\npolicies by Protective.\\n\\nThe deposition of Willie Allmon was\\nintroduced into evidence at the January 6\\nhearing upon which this appeal is based,\\nwithout objection from Moody’s counsel.\\nIt establishes unequivocally that the Allmon\\nlawsuit was solicited by Moody’s agents.\\nThe deposition of Allmon, a farmer from\\nStar City, Arkansas, who has only a sixth-\\ngrade education, is replete with his sworn\\ntestimony that Allmon thought Empire Life\\nInsurance Company was representing him\\nin the federal suit; that Allmon mistakenly\\n‘believed he was represented by Empire\\nlawyers; that maintenance of the suit was\\nnot costing Allmon any money; and that\\nneither Bookout nor Protective had ever\\ndone anything to damage or injure Allmon.\\n\\nThe deposition of Ernest Cross, the in-\\nsurance agent who sold Willie Allmon his\\nEmpire policy, was received into evidence,\\nover the objection of Moody’s lawyer.\\nCross’s deposition establishes that Cross\\nbelieved that Dale Major, an out-of-state\\nMoody attorney named in the January 6\\ninjunction, was an attorney with and legal\\nadviser for Empire; that Major procured\\nfrom Cross the name and residence of\\nAllmon; and that Major represented him-\\nself to Allmon as an Empire attorney.\\n\\nE. State of Texas v. Empire, No. 198,-\\n374, is the ancillary receivership proceeding\\npending in the District Court of Travis\\nCounty, Texas, in which Empire’s ancillary\\nreceiver for the State of Texas sought the\\napproval of the Texas ancillary receiver-\\nship court to consummate the re-insurance\\nagreement whereby Protective assumed the\\npolicies of Empire.\\n\\nAfter listing the various suits, Bookout\\ntestified to Moody’s threats. He said:\\n\\n\\n304\\n\\n“{Shearn Moody] said to me, in\\'words to\\nthis effect, that Mr. Bookout, we are just\\ngetting started on you.\\n\\n“T intend to sue you personally. My\\nactions will be of a personal nature\\nagainst you to carry over after you have\\nleft the office [of Commissioner of In-\\nsurance]. * * * we killed Crawford\\nMartin and somebody else, * * * he\\ndied with a heart attack the day after he\\nsigned his deposition, and we are begin-\\nning on you, and we are going to keep\\non if it takes us 50 years.”\\n\\nAfter the close of the evidence and argu-\\nment of counsel, the injunction was made\\npermanent. In his opinion, Judge Barber\\nstated in part:\\n\\n“The order that was issued temporarily\\nby this Court, does enjoin the filing of\\nother suits and other motions in this case,\\nbut there is a stipulation in the order\\nthat these should not be filed without the\\npermission of the Court.\\n\\n* * * * * *\\n\\n«x * * T think that this court would\\nhave a right to refuse the proposed liti-\\ngation with an eye to see whether or not\\nit is a matter of harassment, a matter\\nwhich would obstruct the orderly carry-\\ning out of the previous decrees and or-\\nders of this court by the Receiver ema-\\nnating from the lengthy hearing that was\\nheld last spring here in this court.\\n\\n* * * * * *\\n\\n“It is a feeling of this Court that based\\nupon the evidence that has been intro-\\nduced at this hearing and through the\\ndepositions that have been presented to\\nme, that there is a very evident effort\\nat delay and harassment on the part of\\nShearn Moody in his activities in this\\ncase.\\n\\n* * * * * *\\n\\n“There has been no evidence to contro-\\nvert the statement that has been made by\\nMr. Bookout in his testimony. There\\nhas been no evidence to controvert the\\n\\nstatement[s] made in the depositions that\\nhave been presented, which is the basis\\nof my ruling in this case.”\\n\\nThe court concluded :\\n\\n“Tt is ORDERED, ADJUDGED and\\nDECREED that\\n\\n(1) any and all policyholders, stock-\\nholders and agents, present or former,\\nof Empire Life Insurance Company of\\nAmerica, and\\n\\n(2) Shearn Moody, Jr., his officers,\\nagents, servants, employees and attor-\\nneys (including, but without limitation,\\nDonald L. Collins, A. Eric Johnston,\\nDale R. Major, Scott E. Manley, A. R.\\nSchwartz, and Thomas R. Beech),\\n\\nand those persons in active concert or\\nparticipation with any of the foregoing\\nbe permanently restrained and enjoined\\nfrom filing, financing, sponsoring, ini-\\ntiating, or aiding, in whole or in- part,\\nin any way the filing of any lawsuit,\\n\\ncomplaint or legal claim, or any amend-\\n\\nment to any complaint or legal claim\\nin any court wheresoever located on\\nbehalf of any party whatsoever against:\\n\\n(1) John G. Bookout, as an individ-\\nual;\\n\\n(2) John G. Bookout as Receiver of\\nEmpire Life Insurance Company of\\nAmerica, his officers, agents, employ-\\nees and attorneys;\\n\\n(3) the Ancillary Receivers of Em-\\npire Life Insurance Company of Amer-\\nica, their officers, agents, employees\\nand attorneys;\\n\\n(4) Protective Life Insurance Com-\\npany, its officers, agents, employees\\nand attorneys; or\\n\\n(5) any other person or legal en-\\ntity which lawsuit or claim relates to\\nor affects directly or indirectly:\\n\\n(a) the affairs of Empire Life In-\\nsurance Company of America;\\n\\n305\\n\\n(b) its receivership;\\n(c) its Receiver;\\n\\n(d) the Treaty of Assumption and\\nBulk Reinsurance, as amended, be-\\ntween the Receiver and Protective Life\\nInsurance Company; or\\n\\n(e) the implementation of any order\\nor decree of this Court in this pro-\\nceeding,\\n\\nunless such policyholders, stockholders or\\nagents or said Shearn Moody, Jr., his\\nofficers, agents, servants, employees and\\nattorneys and those persons in active\\nconcert or participation with them shall\\nfirst receive the prior approval of this\\nCourt.”\\n\\nTitle 28A, § 624(2), provides in Chap-\\nter 28, Rehabilitations and Liquidations,\\nas follows:\\n\\n“(2) The court may at any time dur-\\ning a proceeding under this chapter is-\\nsue such other injunctions or orders as\\nmay be deemed necessary to prevent in-\\nterference with the commissioner or the\\nproceeding, or waste of the assets of the\\ninsurer, or the commencement or prose-\\ncution of any actions, or the obtaining\\nof preferences, judgments, attachments or\\nother liens, or the making of any levy\\nagainst the insurer or against its assets\\nor any part thereof.”\\n\\nThe injunction is well within the stat-\\nutory authorization, and the undisputed evi-\\ndence, both oral and documentary, clearly\\nsupported the issuance of the injunction.\\n\\nThe requirement that parties who desire\\nto bring suit against a receiver must first\\nobtain permission from the receivership\\ncourt is not new in Alabama. In Ex parte\\n\\nDavis, 230 Ala. 668, 162 So. 306 (1935), this _\\n\\ncourt said:\\n\\n“% %* * ‘Property in the hands of a\\nreceiver being in the custody of the court,\\nthe broad general rule established by the\\nweight of authority is that a receiver\\n\\nappointed by judicial authority cannot,\\n\\nin the absence of a statute to the con-\\ntrary, be subjected to suit without leave\\nof the court appointing him’ * * *\\n‘A receiver being an officer of the court,\\nacting under its direction, and in all\\nthings subject to its authority, it is con-\\ntrary to the established doctrine of courts\\nof equity to permit them to be made a\\nparty defendant to litigation, unless by\\nconsent of the court appointing him.\\nAnd it is in all cases necessary that a\\nperson desiring to bring suit against a\\nreceiver in his official capacity, should\\nfirst obtain leave of the court by which\\nhe was appointed, since the courts will\\nnot permit the possession of the receiver\\nto be disturbed by suit or otherwise,\\nwithout its consent or permission. The\\nrule is established for the protection of\\nreceivers against unnecessary and ex-\\npensive litigation, and in most instances\\na party aggrieved may have ample relief -\\nby application on motion to the court\\nappointing the receiver. And when an\\naction is instituted against a receiver in\\nhis official capacity, without first ob-\\ntaining leave of the court, the plaintiff in\\nsuch action is guilty of a contempt of\\ncourt and will be punished accordingly.’\\n\\n“This court is firmly committed to the\\nabove rule. Montgomery, Trustee v.\\nEnslen, Receiver, 126 Ala. 654, 28 So.\\n626; Baker v. Carraway, 133 Ala. 502,\\n31 So, 933.”\\n\\nThe rationale for requiring permission of\\nthe ‘receivership court is to permit that\\ncourt the opportunity to satisfy itself that\\nthe suit or legal proceeding which is\\nplanned will not unduly interfere with the\\nreceiver or the receivership proceedings.\\n\\nHI The mere fact that the injunction\\nwas made permanent does not, in an in-\\njunction as issued in the instant case, mean\\nthat such injunctions do not remain sub-\\nject to clarification and modification by\\nthe trial court. In Ex parte Myers, 246\\nAla. 460, 21 So.2d 113 (1945), this court\\nsaid:\\n\\n\\n306\\n\\n“* * * the court which has rendered\\na final decree in the form of a perma-\\nnent or perpetual injunction in respect\\nto future activities may open and modi-\\nfy it where the circumstances and situa-\\ntion of the parties are shown to have so\\nchanged as to make it just and equitable\\ntodoso, * * *”\\n\\nThis court quoted, with approval, from\\nSontag Chain Stores Co. v. Superior Court,\\n18 Cal.2d 92, 113 P.2d 689, 690, as fol-\\nlows:\\n\\n“% % % ‘this is so because the de-\\n\\ncree, although purporting on its face to\\nbe permanent, is in essence of an ex-\\necutory or continuing nature, creating no\\nright but merely assuming to protect a\\nright from unlawful and injurious in-\\nterference. Such a decree, it has uni-\\nformly been held, is always subject, upon\\nproper showing, to modification or dis-\\nsolution by the court which rendered it.\\nThe court’s power in this respect is an\\ninherent one’ * * *”\\n\\nThe record shows no request by Moody\\nto file a suit against the receiver or any\\nrequest to the trial court for clarification\\nor modification.\\n\\nHE Appellant Moody argues in brief\\nthat the injunction was overbroad. But\\nthe record does not show that that ques-\\ntion was raised in the court below.\\n\\nHI The trial court will not be put in\\nerror unless the matter complained about\\nwas called to its attention by objection or\\nby other appropriate method. Colburn v.\\nMid-State Homes, Inc., 289 Ala. 255, 266\\nSo,2d 865; Pearce v. Brilliant Coal Co.,\\n200 Ala. 630, 77 So. 4.\\n\\n“The general rule is that the appellate\\ncourt, on review of injunction orders and\\ndecrees, will consider only such questions\\nas are raised in the court below, and prop-\\nerly preserved and presented. Where that\\nis not done, the court may refuse to con-\\nsider an objection * * * that the in-\\n\\njunction is too broad in its operation,\\n* * *” 42 Am.Jur.2d, Injunctions, § 350,\\np. 1158.\\n\\nThe injunction was not only justified but\\nwas necessary to preserve the assets of\\nEmpire.\\n\\nIl. Object of Ancillary Suits\\n\\nFiled by Moody.\\n\\nThe principal asset of Empire was the\\nLibbie Shearn Moody Trust. In Moody v.\\nBookout, Middle District of Alabama, Case\\nNo. 74-377-N, Moody’s prayer for relief\\nasked that the receiver and Protective\\nLife Insurance Company be restrained\\nfrom in any way disposing of any of Em-\\nPire’s assets until a final decision on ap-\\npeal in the Supreme Court of Alabama;\\nand that these defendants be enjoined from\\nthe execution and carrying out the or-\\nder of Judge Barber dated June 14, 1974.\\n\\nIn Moody v. Moody National Bank and\\nEmpire Life Insurance Company in State\\nDistrict Court, Galveston, Texas, Case No.\\n112,034, Moody’s prayer for relief asked\\nthat the court reform the terms of the\\nagreement whereby Empire acquired\\nMoody’s interest in the Libbie Shearn\\nMoody Trust “to conform with the intent\\nof the parties and to expressly provide that\\nneither Empire nor any one acting for it\\nmay assign. such interest in the Libbie\\nShearn Moody Trust; * * *”\\n\\nIt is evident that the extraordinary hear-\\nings in this court, S.C, 1125, January 22,\\n1975; S.C. 1221, April 23, 1975; S.C. 1200,\\nMarch 26, 1975 and November 11, 1975,\\nwere either directly or indirectly attempts\\nby Moody to nullify the action of the trial\\ncourt on June 14, 1974, or to get the\\npossession of the Libbie Shearn Moody\\nTrust out of the receivership and back into\\nMoody’s possession.\\n\\nThis court has consistently refused to\\ngrant Moody the relief sought and, insofar -\\nas we are informed, no other jurisdiction,\\n\\n\\neither state or federal court to which he\\nhas applied, has granted him any such re-\\nlief.\\n\\nIl. The Donovan Case.\\n\\n| Most of appellant’s brief and most\\nof his oral argument were devoted to the\\nproposition stated in Donovan v. City of\\nDallas, 377 U.S. 408, 84 S.Ct, 1579, 12\\nL.Ed.2d 409 (1964), that “state courts are\\ncompletely without power to restrain fed-\\neral-court proceedings in in personam ac-\\ntions.” This principle is not new to us.\\nDonovan was cited and applied by this\\ncourt in Johnson v. Brown-Service Ins. Co.,\\n293 Ala. 549, 307 So.2d 518 (1974). [We\\nagree that it states the law and based on\\nthe briefs, counsel for all parties agree that\\nit is the law.]\\n\\nMoody made this argument in trying to\\nshow that the filing of the case of Allon\\nv. Bookout was not in violation of the in-\\njunction issued by Judge Barber.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that the same\\nparagraph in which the previous quote ap-\\npears begins with some careful writing and\\nlimitation by Justice Black, the author of\\nthe opinion:\\n\\n“Early in the history of our country a\\ngeneral rule was established that state\\nand federal courts would not interfere\\nwith or try to restrain each other’s pro-\\nceedings, That rule has continued sub-\\nstantially unchanged to this time. An\\nexception has been made in cases where\\na court has custody of property, that is,\\nproceedings in rem or quasi in rem. In\\nsuch cases this Court had said that the\\nstate or federal court having custody of\\nsuch property has exclusive jurisdiction\\nto proceed. Princess Lida v. Thompson,\\n305 U.S. 456, 465-468, 59 S.Ct. 275, 280,\\n281, 83 L.Ed. 285 [291]. In Princess\\nLida this Court said ‘where the judgment\\nsought is strictly in personam, both the\\nstate court and the federal court, hav-\\ning concurrent jurisdiction, may pro-\\n\\n307\\n\\nceed with the litigation at least until\\njudgment is obtained in one of them\\nwhich may be set up as res judicata in\\nthe other.’ Id., 305 U.S. at 466, 59 S.Ct.\\nat [280] [83 L.Ed.2d 291]. See also\\nKline v. Burke Construction Co., 260\\nU.S. 226, 43 S.Ct. 79, 67 L.Ed. 226.\\n\\nx KD\\n\\nWe have already shown that these suits\\nwere repeated attempts to remove assets\\nfrom the res of the receivership and liqui-\\ndation proceedings. The federal courts\\nhave consistently followed the rule that\\nproceedings involving the liquidation of\\nthe business and assets of an insurance\\ncorporation are in rem or quasi in rem\\nproceedings.

Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., 20\\nF.Supp. 150, 152 (S.D.Cal.), affd 97 F.2d\\n58, 60 (9th Cir.),\\n\\nThis same question was raised in\\nAllmon v. Bookout, Middle District of\\nAlabama, No. 74-377-N, In his opinion,\\nfiled April 24, 1975, Judge Varner dis-\\ncussed Hutchins, supra, and we quote his\\nstatements with approval:\\n\\n“Tt appears to be the settled rule with\\nrespect to suits in equity for the control\\nby receivership of the assets of an in-\\nsolvent corporation that the Court first\\nassuming jurisdiction may maintain and\\ncontinue to exercise that jurisdiction to\\nthe exclusion of any other court. (Ci-\\ntations omitted.)\\n\\n“This jurisdictional priority principle\\nis buttressed by the case of Hutchins v.\\n\\n\\n308\\n\\n+ Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co., 20 F.Supp.\\n150 (S.D.Cal.1937), affm’d. 97 F.2d 58\\n(9th Cir. 1938). In that case prior to\\nany suit being filed in federal court, the\\nState Court vested title of all the assets\\nof an alleged insolvent domestic insur-\\nance company in the Insurance Commis-\\nsioner of California pursuant to his pe-\\ntition. After the State Court—again\\npursuant to the Commissioner’s peti-\\ntion—approved liquidation of the insol-\\nvent company on the grounds that con-\\nservation was futile, the Commissioner\\nfiled a plan of reorganization whereby a\\nnew insurance company was to acquire\\nthe assets of the insolvent company.\\nThe plan, after approval by the State\\nCourt, was fully executed.\\n\\n“Subsequently, suit was brought in\\nfederal\\' court seeking reconveyance of\\nthe assets on the grounds that the entire\\nState proceeding was fraudulent and,\\ntherefore, that the State ‘Court lacked\\njurisdiction. The District Court, in dis-\\nmissing the federal action, stated:\\n\\n“‘This action, and the one in the’state\\ncourts, are actions in rem, or, at least,\\nquasi in rem. The relief sought is pri-\\nmarily concerned with the assets in\\nquestion. The rule in such cases is that\\nthe court first acquiring jurisdiction of\\nthe res has exclusive jurisdiction.’ 20\\nF.Supp. at 152.”\\n\\nOne John S. Bleker, Jr. was granted to\\nintervene as a plaintiff with Allmon. Mo-\\ntion for summary judgment for defendants\\nwas granted.\\n\\nHM We are convinced that Judge\\nBarber did not violate either the letter or\\nthe spirit of Donovan.\\n\\nIV. The Allmon Case—Almon v.\\nBookout, No, 74-377-N.\\n\\nWe have already referred to this case\\nand pointed out that although it was\\nbrought in Allmon’s name, he was merely\\nan unwitting front for Moody.\\n\\nWe were\\n\\ntold on oral argument that after appeal had\\nbeen taken to the Fifth Circuit, Allmon\\ncancelled his policy and dropped out of the\\ncase and that on November 18, 1975, the\\nFifth Circuit vacated the appeal and re-\\nmanded the cause to the district court for\\nappropriate findings of fact and conclu-\\nsions of law as to whether the appeal had\\nbeen mooted.\\n\\nIt is appropriate to show that the prayer\\nfor relief in the original bill in Allmon\\nasked that the defendants be enjoined\\nfrom consummating the reinsurance agree-\\nment; that Bookout be enjoined from ac-\\ntion which might affect Allmon’s rights as\\npolicyholder or creditor; and in the al-\\nternative, joint and several damages of\\n$40,000,000. Once again, Moody was at-\\ntempting to stop the liquidation and to\\nregain possession of the principal assets\\nof Empire. The mere fact that in the al-\\nternative he prayed for damages does not\\nchange the main thrust of the suit from\\nat attempt to secure possession of the\\nassets of Empire.\\n\\nHM Counsel mention in briefs an\\namendment to the complaint in the Allmon\\ncase.

The Appeal in the Original Case.\\n\\nEarlier in the opinion, we stated that\\nthe notice of appeal from the June 14, 1974\\norder in the original case was taken on\\nJuly 25, 1974, but had never been perfected.\\nThis fact is no part of the instant appeal\\non the injunction question, but we feel\\nconstrained to comment on it.\\n\\nThe appeal in the original case should\\nsettle most of the questions in this litiga-\\ntion, but Moody has evidently sought to\\ntry his case in this court piecemeal in a\\nsuccession of requests for extraordinary\\nwrits. The suits in other jurisdictions\\n\\n\\n309\\n\\npreviously listed were also filed after the\\nappeal was taken, At an extraordinary\\nhearing on January 22, 1975, a member of\\nthis court asked counsel for Moody when\\nthe transcript of the record of the appeal\\non the original case would be filed in this\\ncourt. The answer was that it should be\\nhere in about thirty days. Later, at an\\nextraordinary hearing in April, 1975, new\\ncounsel represented Moody and the ques-\\ntion was asked again when the transcript\\ncould be expected and the same reply “in\\nabout thirty days” was given. We con-\\nsidered then and still consider that the\\nanswer given by counsel on both occasions\\nwere made in good faith, Counsel an-\\nswering the second time withdrew from the\\ncase soon thereafter.\\n\\nIn August, 1975, motions to dismiss the\\nappeal were filed but the motions were de-\\nnied. One of the reasons for the denial\\nwas that nowhere was there any writing\\nby this court that attempted to list the\\nharassing and delaying tactics employed by\\nMoody. We have not listed all of them\\nhere but we have tried to mention most of\\nthem. We did not want to put him in a\\nPosition to go to some other jurisdiction,\\neither state or federal, with the complaint\\nthat this court had denied him an appeal\\nby dismissing his appeal in the most im-\\nportant of all suits.\\n\\nBut now, in this opinion, we have tried\\nto give a sufficient account of the many\\nmaneuvers that have taken place in this\\nlitigation, and a sufficient compilation of\\nevents to counter any claim of summary\\ndenial of Moody’s rights to be heard and\\nto have his appeal decided.\\n\\nWe do not intend to be as lenient in the\\nfuture as we have been in the past, re-\\ngardless of the changes in counsel. The\\nrecord in the original case must be filed\\nwithin a reasonable time of the publication\\nof this opinion.\\n\\nThe order and injunction issued by\\nJudge Barber, dated January 6, 1975, is\\ndue to be, and is, affirmed,\\n\\nAFFIRMED.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

Utica was Tuscaloosa Motor’s gar-\\nage liability insurance carrier until 1 June\\n1970; on that date Auto-Owners Insurance\\nCompany became Tuscaloosa Motor’s gar-\\nage liability insurance carrier.\\n\\nThe facts: Tuscaloosa Motor Company\\nmade repairs to the respective cars of Annie\\n\\nLe 311\\n\\nNuckols and Lloyd Johnson. It was stipu-\\nlated at trial that these repairs were made\\nduring the period the Utica policy was\\nin effect. On 1 July 1970 the Nuckols auto-\\nmobile was involved in an accident that re-\\nsulted in damage to it and bodily injury\\nto Nuckols; on 7 August 1970 the Johnson\\nauto was involved in an accident resulting\\nin damage to it. In each instance damage\\nand injury occurred during the period Auto-\\nOwners policy was in effect. Nuckols filed\\nan action for damages against Tuscaloosa\\nMotor alleging that proximate cause of the\\nbodily injury and property damage was\\nnegligence of Tuscaloosa Motor in making\\nrepairs, Johnson filed.an action for damage\\nto an automobile on the same theory of\\nnegligence of Tuscaloosa Motor Company.\\n\\nUtica’s agent, E. Cecil Carver, received\\nnotice of Johnson’s claim on 10 August\\n1970 and Nuckols’ claim on 18 November\\n1970. Utica initially undertook to investi-\\ngate and defend these claims. On 29 Sep-\\ntember 1971 Utica notified Tuscaloosa\\nMotor of its intent to withdraw from de-\\nfense of the Johnson case and on 10 Febru-\\nary 1972 of its same intent as to the Nuckols\\ncase.\\n\\nSubsequently, Auto-Owners Insurance\\nCompany and Tuscaloosa Motor Company\\nfiled an action seeking declaration that\\nUtica was required to defend against and\\nbe liable for any judgment arising out of\\nJohnson’s suit. Utica filed a declaratory\\njudgment action seeking a determination\\nthat it was not required to defend against\\nnor be liable for any judgment arising out\\nof Nuckols’ suit. The trial court found\\nUtica liable to defend against and pay any\\njudgments rendered in both the Johnson\\nand Nuckols suits. It found Auto-Owners\\nliable only for any “excess” damages over\\nand above the limits of liability of the\\nUtica policy.\\n\\nTI The only issue essential to a de-\\ncision is: (1) Does the Utica policy cover\\na liability for negligent repairs performed\\nduring the policy period when bodily injury\\n\\n\\n312 Le\\n\\nduring the policy period, in bodily injury\\nor property damage neither expected not\\nintended from the standpoint of the in-\\n\\nor property damage occurs after expiration\\nof the policy period?\\n\\nThe insuring clause in Utica’s policy\\nreads:\\n\\n“The company will pay on behalf of\\nthe insured all sums which the insured\\nshall become legally obligated to pay as\\ndamages because of\\n\\nG. bodily injury or\\nH. property damage\\n\\nto which this insurance applies, caused\\nby an occurrence and arising out of\\ngarage operations * * *”\\n\\nAn “occurrence” is defined in the Utica\\npolicy as:\\n\\n“% %* * an accident * * ¥* which\\nresults, during the policy period, in bodily\\ninjury or property damage neither expect-\\ned not intended from the standpoint of\\nthe insured ;”\\n\\nIn the “Policy Period; Territory” sec-\\ntion, the Utica policy reads:\\n\\n“This insurance applies only to bodily\\ninjury, property damage or loss which\\noccurs during the policy period * * *”\\n“Loss” is defined in the policy as “direct\\n\\nand accidental loss of or damage to prop-\\nerty”\\n\\nThe trial court found the Utica policy\\ncovered a liability for negligent repairs\\nperformed during the policy period when\\nbodily injury or property damage occurred\\nafter expiration of the policy. To reach\\nthis result the trial court first determined\\nthat there was an ambiguity in the policy.\\nNecessary to an understanding of how the\\ntrial court reached this conclusion are cer-\\ntain provisions of its order and judgment.t\\nIn part, findings in that judgment read:\\n\\n“‘Occurrence’ is defined in the defini-\\ntions section of the Utica policy as:\\n“(An) accident . . . which results,\\n\\n1. We do not necessarily approve or disapprove\\nof any statement of law expressed in the\\njudgment of the trial court, and upon which\\n\\nsured.’ The Alabama Courts have con-\\nsistently held that the term ‘accident’\\nin a liability insurance policy is broad\\nenough to afford coverage when the\\nnegligence occurs during the policy\\nperiod—though the actual damage re-\\nsulting from that negligence may not\\narise until after the policy expires. Thus,\\nin viewing the term ‘accident’ in the defi-\\nnition of ‘occurrence’ in Utica’s policy,\\nthis Court concluded that the Alabama\\nCourts have interpreted this terminology\\nas broad enough to provide coverage in\\nsituations such as those in the two dam-\\nage suits. However, the Court had next\\nto determine whether the accident result-\\ned during the policy period in bodily in-\\njury or property damage.\\n\\n“Paragraph IV of ‘Policy Period; Ter-\\ntitory,’ of Utica’s policy provides that:\\n‘This insurance applies to bodily injury,\\nproperty damage or loss (emphasis added)\\nwhich occurs during the policy period.’\\nIt is uncontroverted that no bodily injury\\nor property damage was incurred by ei-\\nther customer during Utica’s policy peri-\\nod. Thus, the issue was reduced to\\nwhether or not the term ‘loss’ as defined\\nin Utica’s policy was ambiguous such that\\nUtica’s conduct under its policy was rele-\\nvant to a determination of the meaning\\nof the term.\\n\\n* * * * * *\\n\\n“First of all, by Utica’s employment of\\nthe term ‘accidental’ in its definition of\\n‘loss’ an ambiguity was created because\\nof the fact that the Alabama Courts have\\ninterpreted the word ‘accident’ as broad\\nenough to encompass prior negligence\\nwhich results in subsequent damage (see\\nthe discussion supra). Secondly, the\\nAlabama Courts have consistently given\\nthe term ‘loss’ a broad meaning, includ-\\n\\nwe do not rule. His decree is reproduced\\nmerely to facilitate understanding by a reader\\nof this opinion,\\n\\n\\ning a connotation broad enough to en-\\ncompass an ‘injury’, E. g., Mason v.\\nCity of Albertville, 276 Ala. 68, 71; 158\\nSo.2d 924 (1963). And it is axiomatic\\nthat a person incurs a legal injury at\\nthe time a person who owes him a duty\\ncommits a negligent act, rather than at\\nthe time the resultant damages accrue.\\nThus, the question became whether Utica,\\nby its conduct, had indicated the inten-\\ntion that this was the meaning the term\\n‘loss’ was to be given in its policy.\\n\\n‘IT IS, THEREFORE, THE OR-\\nDER, JUDGMENT AND DECREE OF\\nTHE COURT that on trial the Court\\nfinds that the actions of Utica in assum-\\ning the responsibility for investigating\\nand defending, for a period of months\\nwith no reservation of rights, the possible\\nliability of Motor Co. clearly shows that\\nit interpreted its policy to cover the\\nincidents in question, The Court thus\\nholds and declares that Utica is responsi-\\nble for investigating and defending the\\nsuits in question and that Utica should\\nbear any liability which Motor Co. might\\n\\nincur as a result of its negligence caus- .\\n\\ning the two accidents.\\n\\n“IT IS THE FURTHER ORDER,\\nJUDGMENT AND DECREE OF THE\\nCOURT that Auto-Owners is only liable\\nfor any ‘excess’ damages over and above\\nthe limits of liability of Utica’s policy.\\n\\n“The Court finds it unnecessary to\\nreach the issues of waiver and estoppel\\nbecause these actions can be resolved\\n\\nbased on the rationale discussed above.\\neR OK?\\n\\nWe cannot agree that the policy lan-\\nguage is ambiguous. The trial court recog-\\nnized that no bodily injury or property\\ndamage occurred during the policy period.\\nHowever the trial court found ambiguity\\nin the policy because the term “loss” was\\nincluded in the “Policy Period; Territory”\\nclause but was not included in the defini-\\ntion of “occurrence.” In the trial court’s\\n\\nview ambiguity was created because one\\nclause predicated Utica’s liability under the\\n\\n3138\\n\\npolicy on bodily injury or property damage\\noccurring during the policy period while\\nanother clause predicated liability on bodily\\ninjury, property damage or loss occurring\\nduring the policy period,\\n\\nThe clear meaning of the policy language\\nis that coverage is afforded only when\\nbodily injury, or damage to or loss of\\nproperty is suffered during the policy pe-\\nriod irrespective of when the negligent act\\nwas performed which later resulted in such\\nbodily injury, or damage to or loss of\\nproperty. See Mut v. Newark Insurance\\nCo., 289 So.2d 237 (La.App.1973) (reach-\\ning same result). Since there is no am-\\nbiguity, we need not construe the term\\n“accident” as used in the policy. The de-\\nterminative factor is not when the “ac-\\ncident” (negligent act) took place, rather,\\nit is whether or not the bodily injury, or\\ndamage to or loss of property happened\\nduring the policy period.\\n\\nHl Based upon this conclusion we must\\nenforce the policy as written and may not\\nindulge in construction favorable to the\\ninsured. Green v. Merrill, 293 Ala. 628,\\n308 So.2d 702 (1975); Aetna Insurance\\nCo. v. Pete Wilson Roofing & Heating\\nCo., Inc, 289 Ala, 719, 272 So.2d 232\\n(1973). Since the bodily injury and loss\\nof or damage to the property did not occur\\nduring the policy period, Utica’s policy\\ndoes not afford coverage.\\n\\nAppellees argue in brief that Utica is\\nestopped to deny coverage. Like the learn-\\ned trial judge, we find it unnecessary to\\nreach the question of estoppel. There is\\nno ambiguity in Utica’s policy; Utica\\nis not liable under it to defend against and\\npay any judgments resulting from the\\nNuckols and Johnson actions.\\n\\nUnderstandably the result in this case\\nwill appear harsh to the insured. It is\\nthe opinion of the author of this opinion\\nthat the law of Alabama under the issues\\npresented on this appeal will permit no\\nother result.\\n\\n\\n314\\n\\nInsureds are not without remedy how-\\never. Code of Ala., Tit. 28A, § 321, pro-\\nvides for filing with and approval by the\\nAlabama Commissioner of Insurance of\\n“insurance policy forms. Such forms are\\ndeemed approved at the expiration of thirty\\ndays from filing unless prior thereto there\\nhas been affirmative approval or dis-\\napproval. Under the provisions of § 322(5)\\nof the same Code Title the Commissioner\\nmay disapprove or withdraw previous ap-\\nproval of a policy form if it:\\n\\n“Contains provisions which are unfair\\nor inequitable or contrary to the public\\npolicy of this state, or which would be-\\ncause such provisions are unclear or de-\\nceptively worded, encourage misrepresen-\\ntation.”\\n\\nIf, in the future, the Commissioner of\\nInsurance because of limitations of man-\\npower and time is not able to cause filed\\nforms of policies of insurance to be scru-\\ntinized under the standards set out in § 322\\nand in particular § 322(5) this court may be\\ncompelled to declare the public policy of\\nthis State per the views expressed by Jus-\\ntices Jones and Shores in their dissent in\\nthis case,\\n\\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\\n\\nMADDOX and ALMON, JJ., concur.\\n\\nMERRILL and FAULKNER, JJ., con-\\ncur in result.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C. J., and BLOODWORTH,\\nJONES and SHORES, JJ., dissent.\\n\\nJONES and SHORES, Justices (dissent-\\ning):\\n\\nWe note that while the majority of the\\nCourt decides this case to reversal, it does\\nnot decide the issue presented. Tit. 13, §\\n14, Code, as amended. Mr. Justice Embry’s\\nopinion, with which a majority of this\\nCourt concurs in the result, finds no am-\\nbiguity (the basis of the trial Court’s hold-\\ning) and grounds its reversal on the “free-\\n\\ndom to contract” principle. As to the am-\\nbiguity issue, we agree. We would affirm *\\nthe trial Court, however, for the reasons\\nexpressed below.\\n\\nThe freedom to contract rule, particu-\\nlarly in instances involving adhesion con-\\ntracts, where the contracting parties are\\nnot equally capable of negotiating the\\nterms, should be tempered by the dictates\\nof public policy. In the case before us, its\\nunchecked application would allow suc-\\ncessive insurance policies to create a hiatus\\nin coverage with no break in premium ob-\\nligations. Some factual examples will dem-\\nonstrate the fallacy: Suppose, for example,\\nthe Auto-Owners’ policy read differently\\nfrom Utica’s to the effect that “occurrence”\\nmeant the negligent or wrongful act which\\nculminates in liability; or, alternatively,\\nsuppose Auto-Owners, under identical lan-\\nguage, asserted the defense that no cover-\\nage was afforded for negligent acts which\\npreceded the policy period. Would each in-\\nsurer then have an absolute defense even\\nthough the insured had paid for continuous\\ncoverage?\\n\\nStill worse, suppose the coverage remain-\\ned with Utica and the contract of insurance\\nfor the new policy period substituted the\\nlatter definition of “occurrence,” could\\nUtica then plead the alternative defenses\\nunder the identical policy language?\\nWould we then hold “no coverage” on the\\n“freedom to contract” principle? If so, we\\nwould have invited the insurance industry\\nto alternate definitions of language for suc-\\ncessive policy periods and thereby create in-\\ndefinite gaps in coverage; and, in so doing,\\nwe would have interpreted the language\\nhere involved adverse to the insured in each\\ninstance where the total transactions neces-\\nsary to the accrual of an action did not oc-\\ncur within the policy period—all of this, in\\nspite of the insured’s payment of premiums\\nfor continuous protection.\\n\\nIn the event Auto-Owners’ “ex post fac-\\nto coverage” defense is rejected, from the\\nstandpoint of public policy, there are inher-\\nent evils in the imposition of liability\\nagainst the insurer arising out of a wrong-\\n\\n\\n315\\n\\nful act of its insured which takes place\\nprior to the policy period. This would al-\\nlow an uninsured, suspicious that his em-\\nployee has performed negligent repairs like-\\nly to cause an immediate accident, to insure\\nagainst a loss which is almost certain to oc-\\ncur. Such risks on behalf of the insurer\\nwould far exceed that normally contem-\\nplated by contracts of insurance. The only\\nelement in the total chain of the’ liability-\\nproducing events within the exclusive con-\\ntrol of the insured is the initial wrongful\\nact, While the injury-producing accident\\nmust result directly from the culpable con-\\nduct of the insured, ordinarily such subse-\\nquent consequences lie beyond the insured’s\\nimmediate control as to time and place of\\noccurrence. Thus, public policy favors\\ncontracts of insurance in such cases which\\nfixes the coverage concurrent with the time\\nof the insured’s culpable conduct—making\\nthe insured’s and the insurer’s legal obliga-\\ntions coextensive.\\n\\nOther examples may further elucidate\\nproblem potentials. Suppose the garage\\nowner permanently terminated his business\\noperations concurrent with the expiration\\ndate of the policy period, Should he con-\\ntinue his insurance for an additional policy\\nperiod? And, if so, assuming an insurer\\nwould be willing to write the risk, could\\nthe latter company successfully defend,\\neven under the identical language here in-\\nvolved, on the ground that the public policy\\nwould void coverage for risks antedating\\nthe policy period?\\n\\nOnly a minimum of imagination is re-\\nquired to visualize the myriad problems\\narising from such restrictive language in\\n\\n1. For the history of the various clauses in-\\ncluded in the policy and their purported pur-\\npose see: Long, The Lavw of Liability Insur-\\nance, Mathew Bender, 1969. The author\\nobserves that the “occurrence” provision “pre-\\nsents baffling problems since it has to do with\\na situation the reverse of the traditional one\\nof coverage ‘caused by accident.’ But there\\nis a substantial difference between accident\\nand occurrence. ‘The substitution. of the word\\n‘occurrence’ confronts the insurance industry\\nwith new and special problems, They may\\narise out of court expansion of the scope of\\n\\nprofessional malpractice and errors and\\nomissions policies.\\n\\nWe turn now to the case at hand. What\\nwas the insured insuring against? What\\nrisks did it attempt to cover? Tuscaloosa\\nMotor Company’s legal responsibilities aris-\\ning out of its business operations are fixed\\nby operation of law. The law dictates that\\nany injury or damage resulting directly\\nfrom its culpable conduct is actionable and\\nthe action for such injury or damage may\\nbe maintained against it by an injured par-\\nty upon the accrual of such action and for\\nthe applicable period of limitations.\\n\\nThe language of the ‘insuring clause of\\nthis policy commits Utica to “pay on behalf\\nof the insured all sums which the insured\\nshall become legally obligated to pay as\\ndamages .” Tuscaloosa Motor\\nCompany, Inc., could not be “legally obli-\\ngated to pay as damages” any amount to\\neither Johnson or Nuchols until it breached\\nsome duty resulting in injury to them.\\n\\nA cause of action did not accrue in favor\\nof either Johnson or Nuchols against Tus-\\ncaloosa Motor Company until each of them\\nwas actually injured, whether in person or\\nproperty. A right of action against the in-\\nsured did not accrue until the injury actual-\\nly occurred. West Pratt Coal Co. v. Dor-\\nman, 161 Ala. 389, 49 So. 849 (1909).\\nTherefore, the insured could not become le-\\ngally obligated to pay before that time.\\n\\nBy virtue of the definition of “occur-\\nrence,” Utica restricts its liability to\\n“|. , anaccident . . which re-\\nsults, during the policy period, in bodily in-\\njury or property damage a\\nWhile Tuscaloosa Motor Company’ \\'s liabil-\\n\\nthe coverage far greater than that intended\\nby the underwriters when the substitution of\\nwords was made,\\n\\n“The intent of the underwriter being to\\ncover gradual injury, it should follow that the\\ninjury could be exposure to a continuing con-\\ndition resulting in injury extending over more\\nthan one policy period . . ..\\n\\n“When damage is caused by exposure to a\\ncondition extending over policy periods of\\nsuccessive policies, the question is presented as\\nto which policy is answerable. . . .”\\n\\n\\n316\\n\\nity, by operation of law, runs to an injured\\nparty from the moment of injury to the\\nrunning of the statute of limitations, the\\nliability of Utica to Tuscaloosa Motor\\nCompany extends only to injury-producing\\naccidents occurring within the policy peri-\\nod.\\n\\nThus, by contract Utica has limited its\\nliability to its insured to a definable time\\nlimit unrelated to the length of exposure\\nwhich the law imposes on Tuscaloosa Mo-\\ntor Company.\\n\\nIn this case, Tuscaloosa Motor Company\\nhas been sued by two plaintiffs alleging\\nnegligence resulting in injury or damage.\\nThe alleged act of negligence by Tuscaloosa\\nMotor Company occurred within the policy\\nperiod. Utica, however, disclaims liability\\nsince the injury or property damage did not\\noccur during the policy period, but con-\\ncedes that the act of its insured, allegedly\\nproducing such injury or property damage,\\ndid occur within the policy period.\\n\\nUtica, therefore, stands absolved of the\\nvery liability to which its insured is ex-\\nposed by operation of law notwithstanding\\nthe fact that the policy commits Utica to\\n“pay on behalf of the insured all sums\\nwhich the insured shall become legally ob-\\nligated to pay rae\\n\\nUndoubtedly, it is this anomaly which\\nprompted the trial Court to conclude that\\nthe policy provisions created an ambiguity\\nwhich it resolved in favor of the insured.\\nWe agree with Utica, however, that the\\npolicy provisions are clear as to their mean-\\ning and intent. A reading of the language\\nof the policy leaves no uncertainty that\\nUtica by contract has limited its risk of loss\\nby definition of the term “occurrence” to\\nthe extent set out above. It is not on the\\nbasis of ambiguity that we would affirm\\nthe trial Court, but rather because the in-\\ncongruity results in an anomaly which the\\npublic policy of this State cannot sanction.\\n\\nThe provisions of this policy, although\\nunambiguous, leave Tuscaloosa Motor Com-\\npany without a remedy against Utica for\\nthe very liability it sought insurance to pro-\\ntect against. Likewise, it leaves the plain-\\n\\ntiffs (Johnson and Nuchols) without the\\nprotection which Tuscaloosa Motor Com-\\npany sought to provide through its insur-\\nance contract with Utica. This result of-\\nfends the public policy of this State.\\n\\nAs observed by Judge Walter Gewin in\\nNorthwestern Casualty Co. v. McNulty, 307\\nF.2d 432 (Sth Cir, 1962):\\n\\n“Implicit in the entire field of tort lia-\\n\\nbility and insurance law is the concept of\\n\\nfurnishing some protection to those who\\n\\nare injured. Public policy is involved\\n\\nhere Pad\\n\\nWe, therefore, would affirm the trial\\nCourt in holding Utica liable under its\\n\\npolicy.\\n\\n829 So.2d 88\\nHazel V.

Appel-\\nlees cross-appeal, assigning as error the\\ncircuit court’s denial of their several mo-\\ntions to dismiss the appeal from the\\nprobate court to the circuit court.\\n\\nThese appeals arose as follows.\\n\\nOn October 26, 1966, Floy H. Watkins\\ndied intestate in Montgomery County, Ala-\\nbama, leaving as survivors her husband,\\nJimmie Ray Watkins, and her next-of-kin,\\nthe appellees. There was no administra-\\ntion on her estate. She left certain real\\nand personal property at her death,\\n\\nOn April 14, 1972, Jimmie Ray Watkins,\\nthe widower, was remarried to appellant.\\n\\nOn July 9, 1972, Watkins died, leaving a\\nlast will and testament by which all his\\nproperty was bequeathed to his wife, the\\nappellant, who was named the executrix.\\nThe will was admitted to probate in the\\nprobate court, and letters testamentary\\nwere issued to appellant on September 21,\\n1972,\\n\\nOn March 8, 1973, appellees filed a claim\\nagainst Jimmie Ray Watkins’ estate in the\\nprobate court, claiming a share, as heirs,\\n\\n\\n318\\n\\nof the estate of Floy H. Watkins, and\\nclaiming she died owning a separate estate.\\nA contest of the claim, filed by appellant,\\nwas heard in the probate court and that\\ncourt allowed the claim in the amount of\\n$10,920,97 on July 16, 1974.\\n\\nOn August 14, 1974, appellant filed a\\npetition in the probate court requesting “re-\\nmoval” of the administration to the circuit\\ncourt and “appealing” the probate judge’s\\norder of July 16, 1974, which allowed ap-\\npellees’ claim.\\n\\nOn that same day, August 14, 1974, Cir-\\ncuit Judge Richard P. Emmet entered an\\norder transferring the cause to the circuit\\ncourt, (No mention of the appeal was\\nmade in the order.)\\n\\nOn September 27, 1974, appellees filed\\nmotion to dismiss the appeal because ap-\\npellant failed to give security for costs.\\nWhereupon, on October 4, 1974, appellant\\nfiled motion to dismiss appellees’ motion to\\ndismiss the appeal. On November 15, 1974,\\nJudge Emmet granted appellant’s motion\\nand denied appellees’ motion.\\n\\nOn January 23, 1975, appellees renewed\\ntheir motion to dismiss the appeal. And,\\non January 31, 1975, appellant renewed her\\nmotion to dismiss the appellees’ motion to\\ndismiss the appeal. Again, Judge Emmet\\ngranted appellant’s motion and denied ap-\\npellees’ motion, all on February 11, 1975.\\n\\nAppellant then, on August 14, 1975, mov-\\ned to dismiss appellees’ claim on the ground\\nthat it is barred by the statute of limitations\\nof six years, the said Floy H. Watkins\\n(through whom appellees claim) having\\ndied October 26, 1966, more than six years\\npreviously, and the claim not having been\\nfiled until March 8, 1973. [We will treat\\nthe motion as having been filed under Rule\\n12(b) A.R.C.P.]\\n\\nOn August 25, 1975, Judge Emmet denied\\nappellant’s motion to dismiss the claim,\\nfrom which order appellant has appealed.\\nAppellees cross-appeal and claim error in\\nthe trial judge\\'s denial of their two motions\\n\\nto dismiss the appeal from the probate court\\nto the circuit court.\\n\\nIt is appellant’s contention for reversal\\nthat the circuit court should have granted\\nher motion to dismiss appellees’ claim be-\\ncause the claim was barred by the six-year\\nstatute of limitations (Tit. 7, § 21, Subdivi-\\nsion 3, Code of 1940 [Recompiled 1958]).\\nAlthough there was no administration of\\nthe Floy Watkins estate, appellant argues\\nthat appellees could have sought to be ap-\\npointed administrator or could have sued\\nfor their alleged share of her property\\nwithin the six-year period.\\n\\nThe appellees, on the other hand, con-\\ntend, first, that Tit. 7, § 21 refers to actions\\nfor the detention or conversion of specific\\nitems of personal property but does not lie\\nfor recovery of money unless to recover\\nspecific coins, and therefore the circuit\\ncourt’s order appealed from was correct.\\nSecond, appellees suggest that the court’s\\norder denying appellant’s motion to dismiss\\nthe claim will not support an appeal. Final-\\nly, appellees urge that the circuit court’s\\norder denying appellant’s motion to dismiss\\nthe claim was correct because appellant\\nfailed to file security for costs in order\\nto perfect an appeal from the probate\\ncourt’s allowance of the claim.\\n\\nWe think the appellees’ latter contention\\nis meritorious and disposes of this appeal.\\nWe need not consider the appellees’ other\\ncontentions.\\n\\nThere is no question but that ap-\\npellant had the right to remove the admin-\\nistration of the estate of her late husband\\nfrom probate to circuit court. Tit. 13, § 139\\ngives her that right as a matter of law, and\\nwithout any condition annexed thereto as to\\npayment of costs. Ex parte Bell, 221 Ala.\\n304, 128 So, 594 (1930). The order of re-\\nmoval was therefore proper.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when a judgment on\\na claim against an estate has been rendered,\\neither party may appeal to the circuit court\\nwithin 30 days and secure a trial de novo\\n\\n319\\n\\nin the circuit court. Tit. 61, § 216, Code\\nof 1940, as amended by Act No. 324, Acts\\nof Legislature 1943, Regular Session, at\\npage 308. [See Tit. 61, § 216, Recompiled\\nCode 1958.]\\n\\nHH Is the appealing party required to\\ngive security for costs on appeal to the cir-\\ncuit court from the allowance of a claim\\nagainst the estate? We think, under the\\nholdings of our cases, the answer is in the\\naffirmative.\\n\\nThis very issue was addressed by this\\nCourt in Wilkerson v. Hagan, 265 Ala. 515,\\n92 So.2d 901 (1957) (per Coleman, J.).\\n\\n“Does § 216 of Title 61, Code 1940, as\\namended in 1943, require a party to give\\nsecurity for costs as provided by § 782\\nof Title 7, Code 1940, when that party\\nappeals to the circuit court from the\\njudgment of the probate court, in a pro-\\nceeding initiated in and determined by\\nthe probate court under said § 216, to\\ndetermine the validity of a claim filed\\nagainst an estate being administered in\\nthe probate court?”\\n\\nIn Wilkerson, this Court held:\\n\\n“We answer that question in the af-\\nfirmative. In such appeal, security for\\ncosts is required.”\\n\\n* * * * * *\\n\\n“§ 216, Title 61, Code 1940, recites in\\npart:\\n\\n“ex * * Tf the judgment on any\\nsuch claim is rendered by a probate\\n. court, either party may within thirty\\ndays after the rendition of such judg-\\nment appeal to the circuit court of the\\ncounty in which the administration of\\nsaid estate is pending, * * *’ (Em-\\n. phasis supplied.)\\n\\n“In Clary v. Cassels, 258 Ala. 183, 61\\nSo.2d 692, 697 this court said:\\n\\n“%t is provided, also, in Code 1940,\\nTit. 7, § 782, which is applicable here,\\nthat:’ (Emphasis supplied.)\\n\\n“«eTy all other cases in which an\\nappeal is taken under the provisions\\nof this article, the appellant, or some\\none for him, must give security for the\\ncosts of such appeal, * * *” (Em-\\nphasis supplied.)’\\n\\n“In that case, this court held that the\\nsecurity for costs was defective, and that\\ngiving security for costs as prescribed\\nby § 782, Title 7, Code 1940, went to the\\njurisdiction of the circuit court.\\n\\n“[4] Appellant argues that the appeal\\nfrom probate court to circuit court in\\nthis case is ‘governed’ by § 216 of Title\\n61, Code 1940, and not by § 782 of Title\\n7, Code 1940,\\n\\n“That is correct as to the particular\\nelements of such appeal mentioned in and\\n\\n” limited by § 216 of Title 61, Code 1940,\\nsome elements being: Time for taking\\nsuch appeal, trial de novo, trial by jury,\\nand court to which appeal may be taken.\\n\\n“As to particulars not specified, this\\ncourt held in Clary v. Cassels, supra,\\nthat the appeal is governed by the general\\nstatutes. § 782 of Title 7, Code 1940, is\\none such general statute. If we cannot\\nlook to the general statutes, then the\\ncourts would be without rules for guid-\\nance or control as to particulars of ap-\\npellate procedure which are not specifi-\\ncally set out in § 216.”\\n\\n* * * * * *\\n\\n“Our conclusion is that the language\\nand history of the 1943 act do not dis-\\nclose a legislative intent to provide for\\nappeals from probate court to circuit\\ncourt without security for costs, in pro-\\nceedings under that statute.”\\n\\nWe are thus bound to follow our de-\\ncisions in Wilkerson and Clary, supra, so\\nthat when the executrix appeals to circuit\\ncourt from the judgment of the probate\\ncourt allowing a claim filed against the\\nestate in the probate court, the executrix\\nis required to give, security for costs.\\n\\n\\n320 : Le\\n\\nFiling security for costs goes to the juris-\\ndiction of the court and upon failure to\\nso file within 30 days of the order, the ap-\\npeal is subject to being dismissed. Appel-\\nlees’ motions to dismiss should have been\\ngranted.\\n\\nPHB One of our recent decisions dis-\\nposes of the final contention of appellant\\nthat once the cause is removed to the cir-\\ncuit court that court has full authority to\\nre-adjudicate all matters involved in the\\nestate, including those orders heretofore\\nrendered by the probate court,\\n\\nIn White v. Hilbish, 282 Ala. 498, 213\\nSo.2d 230 (1968), per Harwood, J., this\\nCourt held:\\n\\n“Where jurisdiction has attached, a\\ndecree of the Probate Court, within its\\nsphere of jurisdiction, is as conclusive\\nas that of any other court of general\\njurisdiction, and is aided by the same\\nintendments of law. Evans v, Evans,\\n200 Ala. 329, 76 So. 95; Carpenter v.\\nCarpenter, 200 Ala. 96, 75 So, 472, We\\ndo not think that Section 139, Title 13,\\nCode of Alabama 1940, providing for the\\nremoval of the administration of estates\\nto the Equity Court contemplated that\\norders and decrees already finally ad-\\njudicated by the Probate Court on mat-\\nters within its jurisdiction could thereby,\\nby the process of such removal, be deem-\\ned to be vitiated and voided.”\\n\\nThere being no effective subsisting ap-\\npeal in the circuit court from the order of\\nthe probate court allowing the claim, that\\norder stands, and any order hereinafter\\nmade by the circuit court disallowing the\\nclaim would be coram non judice and void.\\nWhite v.

Ronald Storey, Dothan, for appellant.\\n\\nAlto V. Lee, III, and Alan C. Livingston,\\nDothan, for a\\n\\n\\n322\\n\\nSHORES, Justice.\\n\\nThe plaintiff filed suit against City\\nNational Bank of Dothan claiming dam-\\nages for alleged breach of warranty on the\\nsale of a boat. The bank denied the al-\\nlegations of the complaint and filed a mo-\\ntion for summary judgment supported by\\ntestimony of Robert G. Donald, the plain-\\ntiff, Jesse S. Doyle and James H. Eason,\\nofficers of the bank. The plaintiff filed\\na brief in opposition to the motion but\\nfiled no affidavits or other testimony in\\nopposition thereto. The court granted\\nsummary judgment and the plaintiff ap-\\npealed. The only question presented is\\nwhether any genuine issue of material fact\\nexists according to the depositions.\\n\\nAn officer of the bank told the plaintiff\\nthat the bank had repossessed a boat and\\nwas interested in selling it. The plaintiff\\nsays in deposition:\\n\\n“. . . I told him that I was pos-\\nsibly interested in one, because I was\\nthinking about buying a boat to put into\\ncharter service out out of Destin, Flori-\\nda.”\\n\\nThe boat was located at Tibbetts Marina\\nat Panama City. The plaintiff went to\\n\\nPanama City to “look at the boat” and says\\nTibbetts was in the process of making re-\\npairs on it, Prior to purchasing the boat\\nthe plaintiff hired Willings Detroit Diesel\\nof Birmingham to inspect it, He said\\nWillings was unable to make a “running\\ntest” because the engines would not start,\\nbut reported to him that it needed repiping,\\nnew tubes and lines, but otherwise “every-\\nthing appeared okay.” In addition, and\\nagain prior to the purchase of the boat, the\\nplaintiff hired Tibbetts Boat Works to do\\na vessel survey and install new batteries.\\nThis report described the specifications of\\nthe boat and stated that the topsides, deck-\\ning bilges and water tanks were in “good”\\ncondition,\\n\\nThe plaintiff contended that Tibbetts ad-\\nvised him that the generator was being re-\\npaired but would be shipped later,\\n\\nThe bank claims that no evidence was of-\\nfered establishing any warranties; and, in\\naddition, that summary judgment was prop-\\ner since the plaintiff failed to file any af-\\nfidavits or other testimony in opposition to\\nits motion,\\n\\nThe plaintiff contends that there were\\nissues of material fact requiring the court\\nto overrule the bank’s motion. He sum-\\nmarizes these issues as follows:\\n\\n1. Whether the bank is a merchant with\\nregard to the goods sold, giving rise to an\\nimplied warranty of merchantability under\\nTitle 7A, § 2-314, Code;\\n\\n2. whether the bank had reason to\\nknow of any particular purpose to which\\nthe boat would be put, thereby creating\\nan implied warranty for a particular pur-\\npose under Title 7A, § 2-315; and\\n\\n3. whether the bank breached its ex-\\npress agreement to include a generator with\\nthe boat.\\n\\nHl Summary judgment in this state\\nis never proper if there is any evidence in\\nsupport of the party opposing the motion.\\nFurther, Rule 56, ARCP, must be read in\\n\\ncontext with our scintilla rule “. ©.\\n\\n\\nThus, if there is a scintilla of evidence\\nsupporting the position of the party against\\nwhom the motion is made, so that at a\\ntrial he would be entitled to go to the\\njury, summary judgment cannot be grant-\\ned.” Rule 56, ARCP, Comments; Langan\\nConstruction Co. v. Dauphin Island Ma-\\nrina, Inc., 294 Ala. 325, 316 So.2d 681\\n(1975). Moreover, the movant has the\\n\\nburden of showing the absence of any\\ngenuine issue of material fact and all rea-\\nsonable doubts touching the existence of\\na genuine issue of material fact must be\\nresolved against the movant party. Ben-\\nnett v. United Auto Parts, Inc., 294 Ala.\\n300, 315 So.2d 579 (1975).\\n\\nNevertheless, summary judgment does\\nserve a useful purpose. The procedure is\\ndesigned to pierce the pleadings and de-\\ntermine if causes or defenses lack real\\nmerit. It is said “. the rule is\\nintended to prevent vexation and delay,\\nimprove the machinery of justice, promote\\nthe expeditious disposition of cases, and\\navoid unnecessary trials when no genuine\\nissues of fact have been raised.” 10 C.\\nWright & R. Miller, Federal Practice and\\nProcedure: Civil § 2712 (1973).\\n\\nRule 56(e), ARCP, provides in part:\\n\\n. .« When a motion for summary\\njudgment is made and supported as pro-\\nvided in this rule, an adverse party may\\n\\nnot rest upon the mere allegations or °\\n\\ndenials of his pleading, but his response,\\nby affidavits or as otherwise provided in\\nthis rule, must set forth specific facts\\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for\\ntrial. If he does not so respond, sum-\\nmary judgment, if appropriate, shall be\\nentered against him.”\\n\\nThe plaintiff did not file any affidavits\\nor other testimony in opposition to the\\nmotion, However, as noted in the last\\nsentence of Rule 56(e), supra, summary\\njudgment can still only be entered against\\nhim if “appropriate.” That is, the movant\\nparty must initially show the absence of\\n\\na genuine issue of material fact. Dawkins\\nv. Green, 412 F.2d 644 (5th Cir. 1969).\\n\\nBut, since the purpose of a motion\\nfor summary judgment is to test the evi-\\ndence to determine if any real issue exists,\\nthe failure of the party opposing the motion\\nto offer any affidavits or other testimony\\nto contradict the evidence presented by the\\nmovant party leaves the court no alterna-\\ntive but to consider that evidence uncon-\\ntraverted. Epps v. Remmel, 237 Ark. 391,\\n373 S.W.2d 141 (1963).\\n\\nHM Part of the evidence offered by\\nthe bank in this case was the deposition\\nof the plaintiff. If there is testimony in\\nhis deposition which would contradict the\\nfacts as set out in the other testimony,\\nthen the failure of the plaintiff to offer\\ncounteraffidavits or testimony would be of\\nno consequence since repetition of the\\nsame facts in a counteraffidavit would be\\nauseless act. Powell v. United States Steel\\nCorp., 305 F.Supp. 645 (S.D.W.Va.1969).\\n\\nWe turn now to the evidence.\\n\\nTwo officers of the bank testified that\\nthe bank made absolutely no representa-\\ntions whatever concerning the boat; that\\nthe plaintiff was told that all the bank\\nwanted was to get rid of the boat and was\\nnot willing to finance the purchase; and\\nthat it wanted “‘. . to sell the\\nboat as it sits at Mr. Tibbetts[’] dock.\\n\\n”\\n\\nThe depositions of the bank’s officers\\nstate unequivocally that no officer or em-\\nployee of the bank ever made any represen-\\ntation of any kind about the boat, other\\nthan there were no liens or encumbrances\\nagainst it. The plaintiff offered no evi-\\ndence of any express warranty or represen-\\ntation other than as to the inclusion of a\\ngenerator with the boat. He does contend\\non appeal that an implied warranty of\\nmerchantability was made under the pro-\\nvisions of Title 7A, § 2-314, which pro-\\nvides, in part:\\n\\n\\n“>. , a warranty that the goods\\nshall be merchantable is implied in a\\ncontract for their sale if the seller is\\na merchant with respect to goods of that\\nkind 2.4”\\n\\n§ 2-314(c) provides that goods to be\\nmerchantable must be at least such as “are\\nfit for the ordinary purposes for which\\nsuch goods are used; . . .”\\n\\nA merchant is defined by Title 7A, § 2-\\n104(1), as:\\n\\n“, . . a person who deals in goods\\nof the kind or otherwise by his occupa-\\ntion holds himself out as having knowl-\\nedge or skill peculiar to the practices or\\n\\ngoods involved in the transaction\\n”\\n\\nA merchant is defined in Anderson, Uni-\\nform Commercial Code, Vol. 1, § 2-104:4\\n(2d ed. 1970), as follows:\\n\\n“(a) Dealer. He may be a person who\\ndeals in goods of the kind involved.\\nWhether he deals in other goods is im-\\nmaterial. He must deal in goods of the\\nkind involved in the transaction in order\\nto come within the first category.\\n\\n“(b) Representation. He may be a\\nperson who by his occupation holds him-\\nself out as having knowledge or skill\\npeculiar to the practices or goods in-\\nvolved in the transaction. Whether he\\nactually has such knowledge or skill is\\nimmaterial if he so holds himself out.”\\n\\nObviously, a bank may be a merchant\\nunder the U.C.C. definitions (see Official\\nComments to § 2-104); but absolutely no\\n\\nevidence was offered in this case to bring -\\n\\nthe bank within either of the definitions.\\nNo evidence was offered that the City Na-\\ntional Bank of Dothan deals in the kind\\nof goods involved in this transaction—\\nboats—or that it holds itself out as having\\nknowledge or skill peculiar to such goods.\\n\\nThe record before the trial court\\nand here indicates that the sale of the boat\\n\\nwas no more than an isolated transaction\\nby the bank.\\n\\nPrince v. LeVan, Alaska 1971, 486 P.2d\\n959 (9 U.C.C. Reporting Service 367), also\\ninvolved a sale of a boat. In treating the\\nsame issue the court said:\\n\\n“In the present case we deal with a single\\nisolated transaction. Defendants were\\nnot shown to deal in vessels or to possess\\npeculiar knowledge or skill in relation to\\nvessels, Defendants were therefore not\\nmerchants [under U.C.C., § 2-104(1)]\\nand a warranty of merchantability may\\nnot be implied [under U.C.C., § 2-314].”\\nAt 964 (9 U.C.C, Reporting Service at\\n375)\\n\\nThe plaintiff next argues that an im-\\nplied warranty of fitness was made within\\nTitle 7A, § 2-315, which provides:\\n\\n“Where the seller at the time of con-\\ntracting has reason to know any par-\\nticular purpose for which the goods are\\nrequired and that the buyer is relying\\non the seller’s skill or judgment to select\\nor furnish suitable goods, there is unless\\nexcluded or modified under the next sec-\\ntion an implied warranty that the goods\\nshall be fit for such purpose.”\\n\\nIB This provision of the U.C.C. deals\\nwith an implied warranty of fitness for\\na particular purpose as opposed to ordinary\\npurpose under the warranty of merchant-\\n\\n. ability. This warranty is implied if:\\n\\n1. The seller has reason to know the\\nbuyer’s particular purpose; and\\n\\n2. the seller has reason to know that\\nthe buyer is relying on the seller’s skill\\nor judgment to furnish appropriate goods;\\nand\\n\\n3. the buyer, in fact, relied upon the\\nseller’s skill or judgment. J. White & R.\\nSummers, Handbook of the Law under the\\nUniform Commercial Code, § 9-9 (1972).\\n\\n\\nHM Although the plaintiff\\'s deposition\\nindicates that he told the bank officer that\\nhe “was thinking about buying a boat to put\\ninto charter service out of Destin, Florida,”\\nthe record is devoid of any evidence that the\\nplaintiff in anywise relied upon the bank’s\\nskill or judgment (or indeed that it pos-\\nsessed such skill or judgment) that the boat\\nwas fit for a particular purpose, here,\\ncharter service. To the contrary, the only\\nevidence adduced on the implied warranty\\nof fitness for a particular purpose indicates\\nthat plaintiff did not rely on the bank’s\\nskill or judgment. He offered no evidence\\nto show that the bank possessed any skill or\\nknowledge upon which he could have relied.\\nIn fact, the deposition of the plaintiff re-\\nveals the contrary. He, himself, had in-\\ndependent inspections and surveys made of\\nthe boat at his own expense and relied upon\\nthese reports in making the purchase rather\\nthan upon any skill or knowledge of the\\nseller. Sylvia Coal Co, v. Mercury Coal\\n& Coke Co., 151 W.Va. 818, 156 S.E.2d 1\\n(1967) ; Vacuum Concrete Corp. v. Berianti\\nConstruction Co., 206 Pa.Super. 548, 214\\nA.2d 729 (1965).\\n\\nNo evidence was presented to establish\\nan implied warranty of fitness for a par-\\nticular purpose under Title 7A, § 2-315.\\n\\n_ This case is here on the plaintiff’s appeal\\nfrom a summary judgment granted in favor\\nof the bank,\\n\\nHB The only question remaining con-\\ncerns the generator, which the plaintiff\\nsays was not on the boat and which he says\\nhe has yet to receive. In his deposition, the\\nplaintiff says “. . . when I first asked\\nthe bank about the boat, they said, yes, it\\nhad a generator on it.” We think this tes-\\ntimony establishes a scintilla of controver-\\nsy as to whether the defendant made a war-\\nranty with respect to the generator. Since,\\non this issue, a genuine issue of material\\nfact was established, summary judgment\\n‘was improper as to this issue.\\n\\nTI The bank, therefore, was entitled\\nto partial summary judgment; but, as such\\nmotion related to the generator, it should\\n\\n325\\n\\nhave been denied. ARCP 56(b). A par-\\ntial summary judgment is appropriate when\\nseparate claims are involved and there is no\\ngenuine issue of fact as to less than all of\\nsuch claims. Raible v. Newsweek, Inc.,\\n341 F.Supp. 804 (W.D.Pa.1972); Triangle\\nInk & Color Co., Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams\\nCo., 64 F.R.D. 536 (N.D.IIL1974). “. .\\nA separate claim has been defined as that\\nwhich is entirely distinct from other claims\\ninvolved in an action which arises from\\na different occurrence or transaction which\\nform the basis of separate units of judicial\\naction, [Citations omitted].” (64 F.R.D.\\nat 538)\\n\\nSince there is a scintilla of evidence in\\nsupport of the claim involving the generator\\nand since that claim is separate from the\\n\\nclaims involving the alleged warranty of\\n\\nmerchantability, and warranty of fitness for\\na particular purpose, partial summary jidg-\\nment under ARCP 56(b) was appropriate;\\nbut the plaintiff is entitled to a trial inso-\\nfar as his claim that the bank told him\\nthe boat included a generator.\\n\\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part and\\nremanded,\\n\\nMERRILL, MADDOX, JONES and\\nEMBRY, JJ., concur.\\n\\n829 So.2d 142\\nIn re Eugene Bizell PENDLETON, Jr.\\nve\\nSTATE.\\n\\nEx parte STATE of Alabama ex rel.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL.\\n\\nSC 1547.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nJan, 9, 1976.\\n\\n\\n—+—_.\\n\\nJ.

Trant, Clerk\\n\\nThe check and policy endorsement men-\\ntioned in the affidavit were attached.\\n\\nThe trial court decreed that the Hollo-\\nway affidavit was insufficient to contro-\\nvert GEICO’s factual showing of cancel-\\nlation. I think he is correct. In Midfield\\nPark and Fleming neither movant sus-\\ntained its burden. Here, GEICO did. At\\nleast I think it did.\\n\\nThe very purpose of summary judgment\\nprocedure is to pierce the pleadings and to\\nassess the proof in order to see whether\\nthere is a triable issue. But where the\\nmoving party’s papers are in themselves\\nsufficient, the opposing party’s papers at\\nthe hearing on the motion must be suffi-\\ncient to raise a triable issue of material\\nfact. Although he need produce only as\\nmuch evidential material as is needed to\\ndefeat the movant’s burden of clearly es-\\ntablishing the nonexistence of any genuine\\nissue of material fact, he must produce\\nenough. If, of course, all his evidence is\\nneeded to make such a showing it must all\\nbe produced. The evidence considered by\\nthe court in determining a motion must all\\nbe filed prior to the hearing (unless the\\ncourt should allow a continuance for the\\npurpose of procuring additional evidence)\\nand good practice would dicate that a per-\\nson resisting a motion should, whenever\\npossible, make certain that ample opposing\\nevidence is on file, although he may not\\nfeel it necessary to disclose his entire case.\\nHe should also bear in mind that although\\na factual issue emerges as to one or more\\nissues so that a summary judgment cannot\\nbe rendered upon the whole case or for all\\nthe relief asked, the court at the hearing\\non the motion is under a duty, so far as\\nperformance is practicable, to make an or-\\nder stating what issues are and are not in\\ngood faith controverted.\\n\\nHolloway’s statement in his affidavit\\nthat “Faye Anna Davis was insured with\\nGovernment Employees Insurance Compa-\\n\\n333\\n\\nny, a corporation, under policy 662~41-13—\\n3” is as conclusionary as his allegation to\\nthis effect in his pleading; consequently,\\nthat portion of the affidavit is insufficient.\\nThe only evidence which would controvert\\nthe fact of cancellation because of non-\\npayment of premium is the statement that\\na check in the amount of $124.12 dated\\nNovember 1, 1973, was sent to GEICO.\\nThe notice of cancellation was dated De-\\ncember 13, 1973, some 43 days later. I do\\nnot believe Holloway’s papers were suffi-\\ncient to raise a triable issue.\\n\\nHolloway can prevail on his claim only\\nif he shows that the policy was not can-\\ncelled. Once a moving party has shoul-\\ndered the burden of showing there is no\\nmaterial issue of fact (cancellation in this\\ncase), I believe Rule 56(e) and (f) con-\\ntemplate that the non-moving party, while\\nnot required to divulge all his evidence\\nprior to trial, should not be permitted to\\nprevent summary judgment by formally fil-\\ning an affidavit. The better practice\\nwould require the non-moving party to\\nsubmit sufficient proof to show either that\\nthe question of fact (cancellation here) is\\ncontested or that he needs additional time\\nto gather his evidence. See Wright and\\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure, §\\n2738, p. 710 (Obligation of Party Opposing\\nSummary Judgment to Present Evidence).\\n\\nIn any event, the movant probably can,\\non remand, by filing additional proof, ask\\nthe trial court again for summary judg-\\nment.\\n\\nI hope this Court will one day adopt the\\nrule announced by Judge, later Justice,\\nCardozo:\\n\\n“The very object of a motion for sum-\\nmary judgment is to separate what is\\nformal or pretended in denial or aver-\\nment from what is genuine and substan-\\ntial, so that only the latter may subject a\\nsuitor to the burden of a trial.” +\\n\\nEMBRY, Justice (dissenting) :\\n\\nI respectfully dissent.

Subsequently, L & N posted notice\\nof its intent to abolish three operator posi-\\ntions at the Stevenson agency and to re-\\nplace them with automatic equipment. L &\\nN extended the termination date of these\\npositions at the request of the Commission\\nto May 22, 1975. Prior to this date, how-\\never, the Commission sent a telegram or-\\ndering L & N to cease and desist from re-\\nmoving the operators pending a final order\\nin Docket 16943 and informing L & N that\\na written order would follow.\\n\\nThe order was received by mail on May\\n22, 1975, and recited that final action had\\nbeen taken on Docket 16943, that the Com-\\nmission had decided that the joint applica-\\ntion for discontinuance of agency opera-\\ntions should be denied, and that L & N’s\\ndecision to abolish the operator positions\\nwas contrary to the Commission’s decision.\\n\\nOn June 12, 1975, L & N appealed to the\\nCircuit Court of Montgomery County from\\nthe final action of the Commission in\\nDocket 16943.\\n\\nOn the next day, June 13, 1975, the two\\nCommission members filed in the Circuit\\nCourt of Jackson County a motion for is-\\nsuance of order to show cause for contempt\\njudgment against L & N for its failure to\\ncomply and seeking compliance with its\\n“Cease and Desist Order.” L & N re-\\nsponded by filing a motion to transfer the\\nproceeding to the Circuit Court of Mont-\\ngomery County on the basis that the entire\\n\\n335\\n\\nproceeding was properly before the Mont-\\ngomery Circuit Court.\\n\\nThe Circuit Court of Jackson County\\nfound L & N to be in contempt, ordered it\\nto purge itself by compliance with the\\n“Cease and Desist Order,” ordered reim-\\nbursement to the Commissioners for legal\\nexpenses, and provided for a fine of $500\\nper day until L & N purged itself of con-\\ntempt. The contempt judgment and_ the\\nenforcement thereof and all further pro-\\nceedings thereunder were stayed by this\\ncourt pending review.\\n\\nThe matter is before this court on L &\\nN’s petition for writ of certiorari and/or\\nprohibition to review the contempt judg-\\nment of the Circuit Court of Jackson Coun-\\nty.\\n\\nWe address but one issue presented to us\\nby the petition: Did the Jackson County\\nCircuit Court have jurisdiction to impose\\ncontempt sanctions on L & N?\\n\\nThe Commission contends that Title 48,\\n§ 78, Code, places jurisdiction in any cir-\\ncuit court to enforce orders of the Alabama\\nPublic Service Commission. That statute\\nprovides:\\n\\n“In case of failure or refusal on the\\npart of any person to comply with any\\nvalid order of the commission or of any\\n+ any circuit court\\nin this state, or any judge thereof, on ap-\\nplication of a commissioner, may issue an\\nattachment for such person and compel\\nhim to comply with such order . .\\nand the court or judge shall have power\\n‘to punish for contempt as in cases of di:\\nobedience of a like order or subpoena is-\\nsued by or from such court, or a refusal\\nto testify therein.” (Emphasis added)\\n\\ncommissioner . .\\n\\nL &N, on the other hand, maintains that\\nthe Circuit Court of Jackson County had no\\njurisdiction, since an appeal from the Com-\\nmission’s order had been perfected to the\\nCircuit Court of Montgomery County un-\\n\\n\\n336\\n\\nder the provisions of Title 48, § 79, which\\nprovides in part:\\n\\n“From any final action or order of the\\ncommission . . . an appeal there-\\nfrom shall lie to the circuit court of Mont-\\ngomery County . . .”\\n\\nUnder Title 48, § 78, any circuit court in\\nthe state has jurisdiction to compel com-\\npliance with valid orders of the Commis-\\nsion. However, the validity of the order\\ninvolved here is the subject of the appeal\\npending in the Circuit Court of Montgom-\\nery County. We hold that, under ‘the cir-~\\ncumstances, the jurisdiction of the Circuit\\nCourt of Montgomery County is exclusive,\\n\\nIn Walker v. Alabama Public Service\\nCommission, 292 Ala. 548, 297 So.2d 370\\n(1974), rehearing was sought by the Com-\\nmission in a rate proceeding pursuant to\\nTitle 48, § 76, after the order of the Com-\\nmission had been appealed to the Circuit\\nCourt of Montgomery County. Although\\nthe statute provides that a rehearing by any\\ninterested person can be had “At any time\\nafter an order has been made by the com-\\nmission . . .,” we determined that the\\nappeal divested the Commission of jurisdic-\\ntion to grant or refuse a motion for rehear-\\ning and found Title 48, § 76 (providing for\\nrehearings by the Commission), applicable\\nonly to cases not appealed.\\n\\nWe think the same principle is applicable\\nhere. While it is true that Title 48, § 78,\\nprovides that any circuit court may compel\\ncompliance with any valid order of the\\nCommission, it seems clear that this statute\\napplies only to orders of the Commission\\nnot then on appeal to the Circuit Court of\\nMontgomery County. This case is a good\\nexample of the confusion that an opposite\\nresult would produce. The order of the\\nCommission in the instant case had been\\nappealed to the Circuit Court of Montgom-\\n\\nTe nn nnn nen rs eT\\n\\n‘\\n\\nery County. Its validity is being question-\\ned there. The Circuit Court of Montgom-\\nery County acts as an appellate court ia\\nsuch cases, Therefore, the validity of the\\norder of the Commission was before the\\nMontgomery County Circuit Court at the\\ntime enforcement thereof was sought in\\nJackson County. We hold that once an ap-\\npeal was taken to the Montgomery County\\nCircuit Court, no other circuit court had\\njurisdiction to enforce such order under the\\nprovisions of Title 48, § 78.\\n\\nThis is not to say that the Commission\\ncan be stripped of the statutory right to\\nseek compliance with its orders by the fil-\\ning of an appeal pursuant to Title 48, § 79.\\nTitle 48, § 78, permits the Commission to\\nseek enforcement in the Montgomery\\nCounty Circuit Court.\\n\\nOur holding is limited to a finding that\\nthe Circuit Court of Jackson County had no\\njurisdiction to enforce the Commission’s\\norder under the facts of this case.

Both sides submit that the\\ntrial court must be reversed.\\n\\nPlaintiff-appellant filed the suit alleging\\nthat a dispute existed between him and\\nthe defendant-appellee as to the boundary\\nbetween their respective properties. The\\nproperty of both parties begins at a point\\ndescribed as “The Southeast corner of the\\nSouthwest One-quarter of Section 35,\\nTownship 1 North, Range 2 East.” Thus,\\nthe real dispute between the parties is the\\nlocation of the one-half section on the\\nSouth line of Section 35.\\n\\nBoth parties obtained their property in\\nthe late thirties from a common owner.\\nThe original tract was known as the\\n“Gerald Hall Tract.” The plaintiff con-\\ntended that there had been a dispute over\\nthe boundary for many years. It was his\\ntestimony that both sides agreed to have a\\nsurvey made of both pieces of property\\nto determine the proper line. Both agreed\\nthat Mr. Tunstall Bryars, a surveyor of\\nmany years’ experience, should make the\\nsurvey. When his survey was complete,\\nthe defendant disagreed with the boundary\\nfixed by Mr, Bryars. He then proceeded\\nto cut timber on the disputed portion of\\nthe land and this suit followed. Defend-\\nant subsequently hired another surveyor.\\n\\nThe major dispute between these neigh-\\nboring landowners is the true location of\\nthe half section corner of Section 35 since\\nboth ‘deeds call for that beginning point.\\nMr. Bryars testified that the government\\nfield notes call for a distance of 5,280 feet\\nalong the South boundary of Section 35.\\nHe located the half section corner on the\\nSouth line of Section 35 by locating the\\nestablished one-half section corner due\\nNorth on the North line of Section 35. He\\n\\n\\n338\\n\\nalso located from an established corner the\\nSoutheast corner of Section 35 and meas-\\nured a distance of 2,640 feet West. When\\nhe completed running the North/South one-\\nhalf section line, it intersected the South\\nboundary of Section 35, a distance of 12.4\\nfeet West of the stake he had set on that\\nline by measuring 2,640 feet from the\\nSoutheast corner of Section 35. There-\\nafter, he ran West along the South line\\nof Section 35 a distance of 2,652.5 feet\\nwhere he found an old railroad iron with\\npainted lines going in two directions. It\\nwas his opinion that this stake marked the\\nSouthwest corner of Section 35,\\n\\nThe defendant contended that the true\\ncorner of the half section line was some\\n309 feet West of the corner fixed by\\nMr, Bryars and marked by an old pipe in\\na fence row. He contended that this corner\\nhad for many years been accepted as the\\ntrue half section corner. The defendant’s\\nsurveyor did not attempt to locate the half\\nsection corner but made his survey from\\nthat old pipe, accepting it as the true half\\nsection corner,\\n\\nThe case was tried to an advisory jury\\nwhich found in favor of the plaintiff, thus\\nagreeing with the Bryars’ survey. The\\ntrial court thereafter entered its judgment\\nfinding:\\n\\n“I. That the ‘Gerald Hall Tract’ was\\nthought to have contained 38 acres, more\\nor less, when in fact said tract contained\\n51 acres, more or less, That the Plain-\\ntiff purchased 13 acres of said tract\\nwhich constitutes approximately 14 of\\nwhat was considered as 38 acres and the\\nDefendant purchased 25 acres or ap-\\nproximately 34 of what was considered\\nto be 38 acres,\\n\\n“J. That since the ‘Gerald Hall\\nTract’ contained approximately 13 acres\\nmore than was known to the owners\\nthereof, that this matter should be re-\\nsolved by awarding to the Plaintiff 414\\nacres or approximately 14 of the excess\\n\\nlands contained in said tract and by\\nawarding to the Defendant the balance\\nof said property or approximately %4 of\\nthe excess lands contained in said tract.”\\n\\nThe court then went on to order the\\nparties to exchange deeds to accomplish\\nsuch a division of the disputed property.\\n\\nThere was evidence to support the plain-\\ntiff’s version of the true boundary between\\nhis property and that of the defendant.\\nThe jury apparently believed this evidence.\\nOf course, its finding was advisory only.\\nWhite v. Berrey, 266 Ala. 379, 96 So.2d 725\\n(1957). There was also evidence to support\\nthe defendant’s contention that the old pipe\\nin the fence row was considered for many\\nyears to mark the true half section corner.\\nBut the effect of the trial court’s judgment\\nis to fix the boundary line at neither of the\\npoints supported by the evidence.\\n\\nBoth sides to this appeal assert that the\\ncause must be reversed. We agree. In\\nWilson v. Cooper, 256 Ala. 184, 54 So.2d\\n286 (1951), the trial court fixed the bound-\\nary line between coterminous owners equi-\\ndistant between the lines asserted by each.\\nIn reversing, we said:\\n\\n“We are unable to find any evidence\\nin the record to support the decree, In\\nfact, neither party claims that the line\\nestablished by the trial court is the true\\nboundary line dividing their lands, nor\\ndid either party offer evidence to prove\\nthat such a line was the true line.” (256\\nAla, at 185, 54 So.2d at 287)\\n\\nThe same is true here. There is no evi-\\ndence to support the line fixed by the trial\\ncourt. Neither party to this appeal claims\\nthat the line fixed is the true line. Neither\\noffered any evidence to establish such a\\nline. Both parties agree that the cause\\nmust be reversed. ‘Each asks this court to\\nfix the line as contended for by each of\\nthem. We cannot fix the line, but do re-\\nverse and remand the cause to the trial\\ncourt for the establishment of the boundary\\n\\n\\nPd 339\\nDel\\n\\nbetween the lands of these parties, based\\nupon evidence to support such line as fixed.\\n\\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

At the close of the\\nevidence, the trial Court allowed the\\nguardian’s attorney to add a count to his\\ncomplaint based upon the statutory right of\\na grantor to rescind a conveyance which\\nwas given in exchange for the grantee’s\\npromise to support the grantor, Tit. 20, §\\n15, Code. The trial Court, without a jury,\\nthen entered an order cancelling the deed.\\nWe affirm.\\n\\nThe deed sought to be cancelled con-\\nveyed approximately 180 acres of land\\nin Sumter County with an appraised val-\\nue of $30,000. The consideration recit-\\ned in the deed was $100.\" At the time of\\nthe conveyance, Mrs. Moss was 72 years\\nold and was living with Bob Bryant.\\n\\nTM The nephews present four issues\\nfor review. First, the trial Judge should\\nnot have allowed the appellee to amend her\\ncomplaint at the close of the evidence to\\ninclude Tit. 20, § 15, as a ground for re-\\nlief. Second, Tit. 20, § 15, cannot be exer-\\ncised by a guardian. Third, a letter which\\nwas admitted into evidence should not have\\n\\n. been read by the trial Judge because it was\\n\\nhearsay. Fourth, the judgment was not\\nsupported by the weight of the evidence.\\n\\nThe first and second issues presented by\\nthe nephews deal with the propriety of the\\ntrial Judge’s allowing Mrs. Moss to amend\\nher complaint to add a count for rescission\\nunder Tit. 20, § 15. The nephews claim\\nthat they were prejudiced by the amend-\\nment and they also assert that an action\\nfor rescission under Tit, 20, § 15, cannot\\nbe brought by a guardian,\\n\\nWe do not find that the nephews have\\nbeen prejudiced by the amendment. The\\nissue of whether Mrs. Moss granted the\\ndeed to her nephews in exchange for their\\npromise to support her was first introduced\\ninto the case by the nephews in ‘their an-\\nswer, In his direct examination of Bob\\nBryant, the nephews’ attorney elicited testi-\\nmony that Bob Bryant had agreed to take\\ncare of Mrs. Moss in exchange for the\\nconveyance. In essence, therefore, the\\npromise of support was the nephews’ issue\\n\\nand the trial Court cannot assume that\\nthey were suprised by statutory rights\\n\\nlinked to their own issues.\\n\\nHN The second issue is whether a\\nguardian has the power to initiate a rescis-\\nsion proceeding under Tit. 20, § 15, on be-\\n\\n1. Polly A. Moss was adjudicated a non compos mentis and letters of guardianship were issued\\n\\nto Willie Dan Bryant in 1969.\\n\\n\\n342 a\\n\\nhalf of his ward. The nephews’ argument\\nof this issue presupposes that the trial\\nJudge based his order cancelling the deed\\nupon Tit. 20, § 15. Whether the trial\\nJudge based his ruling on this statutory\\nground is not here material, If the judg-\\nment or decree correctly determines the eq-\\nuity of the case, the reasons upon which\\nthe trial Court proceeded are unimportant\\nand the judgment will be affirmed. State-\\nments by the trial Judge showing the basis\\non which his conclusion of fact is founded\\nare not part of the judgment. A correct\\ndecision will not be disturbed because the\\nCourt gave a wrong or insufficient reason\\ntherefor. Cherokee County v. Cunning-\\nham, 260 Ala. 1, 68 So.2d 507 (1953); Geor-\\ngia, Florida, Alabama Transportation Com-\\npany, Inc. v. Deaton, Inc., 293 Ala. 371,\\n304 So.2d 168 (1974).\\n\\nWhere, as here, the testimony is taken\\nore tenus, the findings of fact made and\\nentered by the trial Court will be sustained\\nunless they are clearly and palpably wrong\\nor without supporting evidence, or mani-\\nfestly unjust. Sterling Oil of Oklahoma v.\\nPack, 291 Ala. 727, 287 So.2d 847 (1973).\\n\\nBesides the relief sought under Tit. 20, §\\n15, Mrs. Moss’s guardian also alleged that\\nshe was mentally incompetent at the time\\nshe executed the deed and that Bob Bryant\\nunduly influenced Mrs. Moss, The record\\ndiscloses suffitient competent evidence to\\nsupport the trial Court’s order that Bob\\nBryant exerted undue influence in his con-\\nfidential relationship with Mrs. Moss in\\nthe procurement of the deed.\\n\\nIn transactions inter vivos, where the\\nparties stand in confidential relationship\\nand evidence tends to show that the benefi-\\nciary is the dominant party, the law raises\\na presumption of undue influence and casts\\nupon the beneficiary the burden of repel-\\nling such presumption when the transaction\\nis assailed. Wolfe v. Thompson, 285 Ala.\\n745, 235 So.2d 878 (1970). The evidence\\nis clear that at the time of the execution of\\nthe deed, Bob Bryant held a power of at-\\ntorney for Mrs. Moss, and Mrs. Moss, al-\\n\\nthough she may or may not have been\\nmentally competent, was living with Bob\\nBryant and was not capable of caring for\\nherself alone.\\n\\nThe nephews presented extensive evi-\\ndence to establish Willie Dan Bryant’s re-\\nlationship with Mrs. Moss and to establish\\nher mental capacity at the time of the exe-\\ncution of the deed; nevertheless, the trial\\nCourt was justified, under the evidence, in\\nfinding they did not meet their burden of\\nshowing that the deed was the voluntary\\nand well understood act of Mrs. Moss’s\\nmind and that it was fair and just. Webb\\nv, Webb, 250 Ala. 194, 33 So.2d 909\\n(1948). Therefore, we need not reach the\\nissue whether a guardian may initiate a re-\\nscission proceeding under Tit. 20, § 15.\\n\\nHMMM The third issue involves the ad-\\nmissibility of a letter dated April 11, 1967,\\nsent by Bob Bryant’s attorney to Willie\\nDan Bryant, advising Willie Dan to stay\\naway from Polly Moss. The letter con-\\ntains the following pertinent statement:\\n\\n“This is to advise you to stay away\\nfrom Polly and under no circumstances\\nto take her from Bob’s house to her\\nhouse as you have done recently.”\\n\\nThe nephews contend that the letter is\\nhearsay and was only admitted to prove\\nthat it was received. Therefore, they con-\\ntend, it was reversible error for the trial\\nJudge to read the letter. If the letter was\\nadmitted to prove the truth of any asser-\\ntions it contained, the nephews’ hearsay ar-\\ngument would be valid. However, the sig-\\nnificance of the statement in the letter is\\nnot the truth of any factual matter assert-\\ned but simply the fact that the statement\\nwas made, A statement made out of court\\nis not hearsay if it is given in evidence for\\nthe purpose merely of proving that the\\nstatement was made, provided.that purpose\\nbe otherwise relevant in the case at trial.\\n5 Wigmore, Evidence, § 1361; 6, {bid §\\n1770; Motors Ins. Corp. v. Lopez, 217\\nArk. 203, 229 S.W.2d 228 (1950). We find\\nthat the letter is relevant to this case be-\\n\\n\\n343\\n\\ncause Mrs. Moss’s guardian is seeking can-\\ncellation of a deed to her nephews on the\\nbasis of inadequate consideration and un-\\ndue influence. .\\n\\nIn order to establish a presumption of\\nundue influence in a confidential relation-\\nship, Alabama law requires the grantor to\\npresent evidence which clearly and satis-\\nfactorily shows that the grantee was the\\ndominant spirit, Webb v. Webb, supra.\\nThe letter is relevant to this element be-\\ncause it tends to show that Bob Bryant\\nwas attempting to isolate Mrs. Moss from\\nher other relations; therefore, it was not\\nerror for the trial Judge to read it.\\n\\nThe final issue presented by the nephews\\nis that the judgment was against the\\nweight of the evidence. Since the trial\\nJudge heard the evidence of this case ore\\ntenus, his findings of fact will be sustained\\nunless they are clearly and palpably wrong\\nor without supporting evidence, or are\\nmanifestly unjust. Sterling Oil of Okla-\\nhoma v. Pack, supra. Upon review of the\\nrecord, we are of the opinion that there\\nwas ample evidence to support a conclusion\\nby the trial Court that Bob Bryant unduly\\ninfluenced Mrs. Moss in the procurement\\nof the conveyance.

The undivided one-half interest\\nowned by Marie Smitter was seized by the\\nalien property custodian of the United\\nStates government during the second\\nWorld War. By similar deeds, dated Sep-\\ntember 1, 1955, and October 15, 1955, re-\\nspectively, the Attorney General of the\\nUnited States and Frederic D.

After pre-trial conference,\\nthe parties stipulated that the policies and\\nendorsement provided at least $20,000 unin-\\nsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff,\\nLawrence D, Smeiley, an Alabama State\\nTrooper. The question of whether the en-\\ndorsement provided an additional $10,000 in\\ncoverage was submitted to the trial Judge,\\nwho ruled that the endorsement did pro-~\\nvide an extra $10,000 coverage. Farm Bu~\\nreau admitted liability and the case was\\n\\ntried to a jury solely on the issue of dam-\\nages. The jury returned a verdict of\\n\\n$17,500 in favor of the plaintiff.\\n\\nFarm Bureau appeals, primarily assert-\\ning four errors. First, Farm Bureau\\nclaims the Judge erroneously found that\\nthe endorsement provided an additional\\n$10,000 coverage; therefore, his instruc-\\ntions to the jury that they could return a\\nmaximum verdict of $30,000 was error,\\nSecond, the trial Judge erroneously refused\\nFarm Bureau’s requested instructions that\\nthe jury could not award damages for\\nmedical bills not paid for by the plaintiff,\\nand the trial Judge allowed into evidence\\nthe amount of Smelley’s medical bills with-\\nout proof that Smelley had paid them,\\nThird, Farm Bureau claims that there was\\nno evidence’ that Smelley suffered perma~\\nnent injuries, loss of future earnings or\\nloss of future earning capacity; therefore,\\nit was error for the trial Judge to admit\\n\\nmortality tables into evidence and instruct\\nthe jury as to those elements of damages.\\nFourth, the verdict of $17,500 is excessive.\\nWe will address these issues in order,\\n\\nI First, for the purpose of this ap-\\npeal, we assume without deciding that the\\ntrial Judge was in error in finding that the\\nendorsement provided an additional $10,000\\ncoverage. We nevertheless hold that the\\nerror of instructing the jury that they\\ncould return a verdict up to $30,000 was\\nrendered harmless by the jury’s returning\\na verdict of $17,500. ARAP 45 provides:\\n\\n“No judgment may be reversed or set\\naside, nor new trial granted in any civil\\nor criminal case on the ground of mis-\\ndirection of the jury, the giving or re-\\nfusal or special charges or the improper\\nadmission or rejection of evidence, nor\\nfor error as to any matter of pleading or\\nprocedure, unless in the opinion of the\\ncourt to which the appeal is taken or ap-\\nplication is made, after an examination\\nof the entire cause, it should appear that\\nthe error complained of has probably in-\\njuriously affected substantial rights of\\nthe parties.”\\n\\nThe alleged erroneous instruction only\\ninformed the jury that their verdict could\\nnot exceed $30,000; it did not indicate to\\nthe jury that $30,000 or any other amount\\nwas justified by the evidence. Farm Bu-\\nreau argues that by extending the limits of\\ntheir liability, the instruction persuaded the\\njury to return a higher verdict than it\\nwould have returned if the maximum lia-\\nbility had been $20,000. However, the\\nmaximum limit of recovery is not an ele-\\nment of damages, and we cannot assume,\\nwithout proof, that the jury disregarded its\\nobligation to reach a verdict based on evi-\\ndence of damages properly before them.\\nFor other cases holding that an erroneous\\ninstruction may be rendered harmless by\\nthe jury verdict, see W. E. Belcher Lumber\\nCo. v. Woodstock Land & Mineral Co., 245\\nAla. 5, 15 S0.2d 625 (1943); Hill v. Wy-\\nrosdick, 216 Ala. 235, 113 So. 49 (1927).\\n\\n\\nES ——————\\n\\nHMM Farm Bureau’s second argument\\nis that the trial Judge erroneously refused\\nits requested instruction that the jury could\\nnot award damages for medical bills which\\nwere not paid by Smelley. The trial\\nJudge’s instruction on this issue, which was\\ntaken from Alabama Pattern Jury Instruc-\\ntions, § 11.09, clearly informs the jury that\\ndamages for medical expenses are to be al-\\nlowed only “for doctor’s and medical bills\\nwhich the plaintiff has paid or has become\\nobligated to pay.” This is a correct state-\\nment of the law, and we find no error in\\nthe Court’s refusing additional instructions.\\nFarm Bureau also objects to the introduc-\\ntion of evidence of the plaintiff\\'s medical\\nbills without any proof that the plaintiff\\nhas paid them. Farm Bureau cites Title\\n36, § 58(69), Code, as evidence that the\\nState of Alabama insured against the hos-\\npital and medical expenses of the plaintiff.\\nHowever, evidence that an insured has\\nbeen compensated for a loss by an indem-\\n\\n“nity insurer is not admissible in Alabama\\nnotwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff\\nhas introduced evidence of the amount of\\nmedical expenses incurred by the plaintiff.\\nVest v. Gay, 275 Ala. 286, 154 So.2d 297\\n(1963). Since the parties have stipulated\\nto the reasonableness of the bills, the trial\\nJudge committed no error by admitting the\\nevidence of the plaintiff\\'s hospital and\\nmedical bills.*\\n\\nHl Third, Farm Bureau claims that\\nmortality tables were introduced into evi-\\ndence despite the fact that there was no\\nevidence of permanent injuries, loss of fu-\\nture earnings, or earning capacity. In Al-\\nabama, mortality tables are admissible\\nwhen there is evidence (even though it\\nmay be controverted) from which the jury\\nmay draw a reasonable inference that a\\nplaintiff\\'s injuries are permanent. Louis-\\nville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Richard-\\nson, 285 Ala. 281, 231 So.2d 316 (1970);\\n\\n1. We recognize that Alabama has been cited\\nas the only jurisdiction contra to the general\\nprinciple of the “collateral source” rule.\\nTorts—Cases and Materials, Green et al.\\n\\n349\\n\\nLouisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v.\\nSteel, 257 Ala. 474, 59 So.2d 664 (1952) ;\\nSouthern Railway Co. v. Cunningham, 152\\nAla. 147, 44 So, 658 (1907). If the tables\\nare admitted, they may be used by the jury\\nto determine the plaintiff\\'s impaired or di-\\nminished earning capacity. Alabama Great\\nSouthern Railroad Co. v. Gambrell, 262\\nAla, 290, 78 So.2d 619 (1955).\\n\\nHB We have examined the record for\\nspecific legal evidence from which the jury\\ncould draw a reasonable inference that\\nSmelley suffered permanent injuries. The\\nrecord reveals that he was involved in an\\nautomobile accident on October 6, 1974,\\nand was taken to the emergency room of\\nEliza Coffee Memorial Hospital, The doc-\\ntor who examined Smelley in the emergen-\\ncy room testified that he was complaining\\nof severe neck pain plus pain in the chest\\nand hip, An examination of Smelley re-\\nvealed that he had a cerebral concussion,\\ncervical strain, muscle spasms in the shoul-\\ndet blade area, and separation of rib carti-\\nlages, An x-ray of Smelley’s spine re-\\nvealed a narrowing of the L-5 vertebra.\\nSince the accident, the doctor testified,\\nSmelley had apparently developed bursitis\\nin his shoulder blade radiating out his\\nright upper extremity, which was treated\\nwith an injection into the muscle under his\\ncollarbone. The doctor also testified, “I\\nthink the chances are that he will have\\nsome recurrent pain in his neck and as\\ntime goes by, some -arthritic changes.”\\nSmelley testified that since the accident he\\nhas had constant pain in his shoulder\\nwhich has hampered his ability to move his\\nshoulder. He also testified that he has had\\nrecurring lower back pain, headaches and\\ndizziness.\\n\\nOn cross examination, the doctor stated\\nthat the only positive permanent injury\\nSmelley suffered was to his L-5 disk, but\\n\\n1968; 14 Ala.L.Rev. 148. This results from\\na misconstruction of Jones v. Keith, 228\\nAla. 36, 134 So. 680 (1981), and overlooks\\nlater case law development.\\n\\n\\n350\\n\\nthe doctor stated that he could not say that\\nplaintiff would not have some future trou-\\nble with his neck, The doctor also stated\\nthat he was not able to say that the injury\\nto Smelley’s spine definitely resulted from\\nthe injury.\\n\\nThe plaintiff introduced evidence of loss\\nof earning capacity or future income on\\ndirect examination, The plaintiff is em-\\nployed as an Alabama State Trooper. His\\njob requires extensive driving and possibly\\narresting unwilling persons. He testified\\nthat the pain in his lower back is especially\\ntroublesome after driving and the doctor\\ntestified that any vigorous activity such as\\narresting unwilling persons “might trigger\\nsome of his muscle spasm and pain over\\nagain or else his pain under his shoulder\\nblade.”\\n\\nIn our opinion, the jury could draw a\\nreasonable inference from. this evidence\\nthat Smelley suffered permanent injuries\\nwhich would impair his future earning ca-\\npacity. Therefore, it was not error to ad-\\nmit the mortality tables.\\n\\nHl Farm Bureaw’s fourth argument is\\nthat the verdict is excessive. We have al-\\nready recited the testimony of Smelley’s\\npain from his injuries to his spine, shoul-\\nder, and ribs and the potential for contin-\\nued pain from bursitis in his shoulder and\\nthe narrowing of his lumbar disk. There\\nis also evidence which indicates that Smel-\\nley’s capacity to pursue his occupation has\\nbeen impaired. The trial Judge overruled\\nFarm Bureaw’s motion for a new trial on\\nthe ground that the verdict was excessive;\\nand, in our opinion, the verdict does not\\nindicate passion, prejudice, corruption, or\\nmistake on the part of the jury.

In such a hearing, the trial\\njudge sitting alone should make a deter-\\nmination upon a proper record of the is-\\nsue of voluntariness. . . If the\\nconfession is held voluntary and admit-\\nted, the jury’s consideration of that con-\\nfession and surrounding circumstances\\nshall proceed in accordance with the ‘Or-\\nthodox’ procedure, that is, the jury con-\\nsiders the voluntariness as affecting the\\nweight or credibility of the confession.”\\n[Emphasis supplied.]\\n\\n278 Ala. at 165, 176 So.2d at 859,\\n\\nThis is exactly what is suggested by the\\nU. S. Supreme Court in the opinion in\\nJackson v. Denno, supra, in Note 13:\\n\\n“The question of the credibility of a\\nconfession, as distinguished from its ad-\\nmissibility, is submitted to the jury in\\njurisdictions following the orthodox\\nMassachusetts, or New York procedure.\\nSince the evidence surrounding the mak-\\ning of a confession bears on its credibi-\\nty, such evidence is presented to the jury\\nunder the orthodox rule not on the issue\\nof voluntariness or competency of the\\nconfession, but on the issue of\\nweight. Just as questions of admissibili-\\nty of evidence are traditionally for the\\ncourt, questions of credibility, whether\\nof a witness or a confession, are for the\\njury. This is so because trial courts do\\nnot direct a verdict against the defend-\\nant on issues involving credibility.\\nNothing in this opinion, of course,\\ntouches upon these ordinary rules of evi-\\ndence relating to impeachment.\\n\\n“A finding that the confession is vol-\\nuntary prior to admission no more af-\\nfects the instructions on or the jury’s\\nview of the reliability of the confession\\n\\nthan a finding in a preliminary hearing\\nthat evidence was not obtained by an il-\\nlegal search affects the instructions on\\nor the jury’s view of the probativeness\\nof this evidence.” [Emphasis supplied.]\\n\\n378 U.S. at 386-87, 84 S.Ct. at 1786, 12 L.\\nEd.2d at 921,\\n\\nUnder the rationale of these decisions,\\nhow can the jury consider “the voluntari-\\nness as affecting the weight or credibility\\nof the confession” unless the state presents\\nevidence as to the “Miranda” and “volun-\\ntariness” predicates to the jury? The an-\\nswer seems to us to be self-evident, assum-\\ning, of course, that seasonable and proper\\nobjection is made by defendant, if such ev-\\nidence is not presented by the state before\\na confession or inculpatory statement is of-\\nfered. This, for the reason that defense\\ncounsel may decide for reasons of trial\\nstrategy it would not be desirable, from de-\\nfendant’s standpoint, to rehash this evi-\\ndence before the jury.

State, 254 So.2d 750 (Miss.1971),\\nwrote that after the court [in an out-of-\\ncourt hearing] had “found that the confes-\\nsion was competent evidence it allowed the\\nstate, over the objection of the defendant,\\nlo introduce a confession into evidence\\nwithout showing that the confession had\\nbeen freely and voluntarily given, When\\nthe defendant sought by cross examination\\nof the witness relative to the circumstances\\nsurrounding the giving of the confession,\\nthe court sustained objections by the state\\nand refused to allow the defendant to fully\\nshow the circumstances surrounding the\\ngiving of the confession.” [Emphasis sup-\\nplied.] Jd. at 754.\\n\\nThe court then held, viz:\\n\\nIt was the opinion of the\\ntrial judge that since the court had held\\nthe confession was competent evidence,\\nthe only thing that defendant could show\\nwas that the confession was not true.\\n\\n\\n353\\n\\nIn so holding the court was in error. It\\nhas long been the law of this state, that\\nbefore a confession can be received in\\nevidence, it must be shown to be compe-\\ntent in that it was freely and voluntarily\\ngiven. This js a legal question to be de-\\ntermined by the court on a preliminary\\ninvestigation out of the presence of the\\njury. If, after hearing all the testimony\\npertinent to the inquiry, the court is sat-\\nisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the\\nconfession was freely and voluntarily\\ngiven, it becomes competent evidence.\\nHowever, after a confession has been\\nheld by the court to be competent evi-\\ndence either party has a right to intro-\\nduce before the jury the same evidence\\nwhich was submitted on the preliminary\\ninquiry as well as any other evidence\\nrelative to the weight and credibility of\\nthe confession. The jury does not pass\\nupon the competency of the confession,\\nbut the jury does pass upon the weight\\nand credibility of the confession.”\\n\\nId, Although strictly speaking Rhone\\nmerely stands for the proposition that a\\ndefendant should be allowed to introduce\\nevidence of “involuntariness” before a con-\\nfession is shown to the jury, we think it\\ninfers that the state should show the vol-\\nuntariness to the jury. Any other conclu-\\nsion misconceives the law and burden of\\nproof. Under Alabama law, a confession\\nis prima facie involuntary and inadmissi-\\nble. The burden is on the-state to rebut\\nthat presumption and show its “voluntari-\\nness” and that the “Miranda” predicate\\nwas laid in order to admit it. True, the\\ntrial judge makes a preliminary determina-\\ntion of admissibility but the jury is still\\nleft with its duty to consider “voluntari-\\nness as affecting the weight or credibility\\nof the confession.” Duncan, supra. To do\\nthat, it must hear at least a “bare bones”\\nvoluntariness and Miranda predicate. To\\nhold otherwise would shift the burden to\\nthe defendant to show these matters to the\\n\\njury.\\n\\nThe Iowa Supreme Court in State v.\\nHolland,. 258 Iowa 206, 138 N.W.2d 86\\na\\n\\n(1965), stated that we conceive the correct\\ntule to be:\\n\\n“We note that after the trial court\\nruled the confessions were admissible\\nand they were received in evidence be-\\nfore the jury, testimony was again ad-\\nmitted as to their voluntary character. It\\nwas proper to do this, not to permit the\\njury again to pass upon their admissibility\\n—that had been properly determined by\\nthe court—but as bearing upon the weight\\nto be accorded them and the credibility of\\nthe witnesses who testified regarding the\\nconfessions. . .\\n\\n“Our approval of the procedure used\\nhere is in accord with the view of both\\nthe Wisconsin and Michigan courts in\\napproving the so-called ‘orthodox’ over\\nthe ‘Massachusetts’ method of determin-\\ning the question of voluntariness.\\n. [Citations omitted.]” [Empha-\\nsis supplied.]\\n\\nId, at 214, 138 N.W.2d at 91.\\n\\nWe think that the dissent has miscon-\\nceived the question. The issue to the jury\\nis not admissibility. That has already been\\ndetermined by the judge en camera.\\n\\nWe believe that the dissent also miscon-\\nceives the rule of law in our State respec-\\nting confessions. It is not, as the dissent\\nsuggests, “At the defendant’s insistance,\\n[that] the State must first overcome the\\npresumption against voluntariness en cam-\\nera.” Our rule is that a confession is pri-\\nma facie involuntary and inadmissible and\\nits voluntariness must be shown by the\\nstate. There is no requirement that it\\nmust be “At the defendant’s insistance.”\\n\\nAgain, we believe that the dissent has\\nmisconceived the nature and purpose of de-\\nfendant’s objection to the confession when\\nthe inculpatory statement was offered and\\ndefendant’s counsel stated that “No proper\\npredicate” was laid. The purpose of the\\nobjection was not, as the dissent suggests,\\n“to preserve for review the trial Court’s\\nruling on admissibility.” That purpose had\\n\\n\\n354\\n\\nalready been served by defendant’s objec-\\ntions en camera. Defendant does not have\\nto repeat the objection to preserve for re-\\nview the question of admissibility. It is\\nobvious that the reason for the objection\\nwas, as we suggest, to require the state to\\ndo, what is necessary for it to do, to show\\nto the jury evidence for the jury’s consid-\\neration of “the voluntariness as affecting\\nthe weight or credibility of the confes-\\nsion.” Duncan, supra.\\n\\nWe do not overturn, as the dissent sug-\\ngests we do, “the traditional distinction be-\\ntween admissibility and credibility,” rather\\nwe follow that which we believe to be the\\nprevailing practice which the circuit judges\\nof Alabama have followed for years.\\n\\nAFFIRMED.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C. J. and MERRILL,\\nFAULKNER, ALMON, SHORES, and\\nEMBRY, JJ., concur.\\n\\nMADDOX and JONES, JJ., dissent.\\n\\nMADDOX, Justice (dissenting).\\n\\nIt appears to me that the majority has\\ngiven the defendant the best of two worlds.\\nHe was allowed to object when the state\\nattempted to lay a predicate before the\\njury, which he had a right to do under\\nJackson v. Denno, saying “Judge, that [ad-\\nmissibility] is not a jury issue,” and now\\nthe majority permits him to object on the\\nground that the state did not show the pred-\\nicate to the jury. If Lewis had been refused\\npermission to cross-examine the state’s wit-\\nnesses before the jury on the voluntariness\\nof the statement, as happened in the Missis-\\nsippi case, Rhone v. State, relied on so\\nstrongly by the majority, I would agree\\nwith the majority, because a defendant has\\na right to cross-examine the witnesses rela-\\ntive to the circumstances surrounding the\\ngiving of the confession.\\n\\nThe record here, however, shows that\\ndefendant’s lawyer had this right of cross-\\nexamination, not once, but three times—on\\n\\na motion to suppress hearing, at the Jack-\\nson v. Denno hearing, and again before the\\njury. In fact, cross-examination of the of-\\nficers concerning the circumstances sur-\\nrounding the statement by Lewis makes up\\na substantial portion of the record on ap-\\npeal. .\\n\\nThe majority “infers” that Rhone [the\\nMississippi case] stands for the proposition\\nthat “the state should show the voluntari-\\nness to the jury.” How the majority can\\nmake such an inference in view of the\\nplain language of Rhone escapes me. I set\\nout and underline portions of the Rhone\\nopinion which convinces me that the ma-\\njority makes what, I believe, is an incor-\\nrect inference.\\n\\n“After the court found that the con-\\nfession was competent evidence it al-\\nlowed the state, over the objection of the\\ndefendant, to introduce a confession into\\nevidence without showing that the con-\\nfession had been freely and voluntarily\\ngiven. When the defendant sought by\\ncross examination of the witness relative\\nto the circumstances surrounding the\\ngiving of the confession, the court sus-\\ntained objections by the state and\\nrefused to allow the defendant to fully\\nshow the circumstances surrounding the\\ngiving of the confession. It was the\\nopinion of the trial judge that since the\\ncourt had held the confession was com-\\npetent evidence, the only thing that de-\\nfendant could show was that the confes-\\nsion was not true. In so holding the\\ncourt was in error. It has long been the\\nlaw of this state, that before a confes-\\nsion can be received in evidence, it must\\nbe shown to be competent in that it was\\nfreely and voluntarily given. This is a\\nlegal question to be determined by the\\ncourt on a preliminary investigation out\\nof the presence of the jury. If, after\\nhearing all the testimony pertinent to the\\n“inquiry, the court is satisfied beyond a\\nreasonable doubt that the confession was\\nfreely and voluntarily given, it becomes\\ncompetent evidence. However, after a\\nconfession has been held by the court to\\n\\n\\n355\\n\\nbe competent evidence either party has a\\nright to introduce before the jury the\\nsame evidence which was submitted on\\nthe preliminary inquiry as well as any\\nother evidence relative to the weight and\\ncredibility of the confession. The jury\\ndoes not pass upon the competency of\\nthe confession, but the jury does pass\\nupon the weight and credibility of the\\nconfession. The jury has the same free-\\ndom of action in relation to confessions\\nwhich they have in regard to other testi-\\nmony. In the case before us, the court\\nrefused to allow the appellant to fully\\nshow the circumstances surrounding the\\ngiving of the confession, although coun-\\nsel for the appellant made a valiant effort\\nto get this evidence before the jury.\\nThis effectively deprived the appellant\\n\\nof a valuable right and was reversible -\\n\\nerror.’ [Emphasis added.]\\n\\nIt is clear to me that the Court in\\nRhone, reversed the case because the de-\\nfendant was refused permission to cross-\\nexamine witnesses and show the circum-\\nstances surrounding the giving of the con-\\nfession. In this, I agree with Rhone’s\\nholding.\\n\\nAnother point in the majority opinion\\nbothers me, The Court of Criminal Ap-\\npeals’ opinion, and the majority opinion,\\nstates that the state must show that the\\nMiranda warnings were given. The opin-\\nion of the Court of Criminal Appeals erro-\\nneously states that this was not done. The\\nmajority holds that the state must show a\\nMiranda warning.\\n\\nIn any event, the state showed a Miran-\\nda warning in this case. The record\\nshows:\\n\\n“BY MR. KULAKOWSKI:\\n\\nQ Now, Officer Seals, on March 18,\\n1974, you testified that you had made a\\nsearch of the apartment at 269 Rickarby\\nStreet, here in Mobile County.\\n\\nI will ask you, after the capsules of\\nwhite substance were found in the bed-\\nroom, and after the defendant Winston\\n\\nLewis was brought back by Officer Cal-\\nhoun and Officer Orso after he jumped\\nout the window, I will ask you then if\\nyou placed them under arrest ?\\n\\nA Yes; I did.\\n\\nQ Okay. Were they then advised of\\ntheir Constitutional rights?\\n\\nA Yes.”\\n\\nDean Wigmore, in his work Wigmore on\\nEvidence, § 861, Vol. III, (1970), discusses\\nthe point here involved, as follows:\\n\\n“Judge and jury; whether the confes-\\nsion is voluntary is a question for the\\njudge. (a) The admissibility of the con-\\nfession, as affected by the foregoing\\nrules, is a question for the judge, on ele-\\nmentary principles defining the functions\\nof judge and jury, . . . This\\northodox principle is recognized in a\\nsubstantial number of jurisdictions.\\n[Alabama is listed as one of these juris-\\ndictions,]\\n\\n“But in comparatively recent times the\\nheresy of leaving the question to the\\njury has made rapid strides.\\n\\n“To say that it is a question for the\\njury may mean one of two things. It\\nmay mean that the confession goes in\\nany case to the jury to accept or to re-\\nject or to give such weight as the jury\\nchooses; this practically abolishes all the\\nforegoing limitations. But it may, and\\ncommonly does, mean that the jury may\\nbe allowed to measure it by the forego-\\ning legal tests, and to reject it as a judge\\nwould if the tests are not fulfilled. This\\nis decidedly improper; first, because it\\nmakes abject surrender of the fixed\\nprinciple that all questions of admissibili-\\nty are questions of law for the judge\\nonly; secondly, because the confession\\nrules do not attempt to measure the ulti-\\nmate value of a given confession, and\\nthe tribunal which is to weigh all evi-\\ndence finally ought not to be artificially\\nhampered by them; thirdly, because the\\njury is not familiar enough with them to\\n\\n\\n356\\n\\nattempt to employ them. Nevertheless,\\nmany courts today hold that, after the\\njudge has applied the rules and admitted\\nthe confession, the jury are to apply\\nthem again, and by that test may reject\\nit. This unpractical- heresy fails to ap-\\npreciate the elementary canon of admis-\\nsibility and in that aspect its judicial ex-\\ntension has been a discouraging circum-\\nstance.”\\n\\nThe defendant is entitled to have the\\ntrial court charge the jury on the law rela-\\ntive to confession; he is allowed to cross-\\nexamine witnesses and present evidence\\ntouching the issue of voluntariness of a\\nconfession, but he is not entitled, in my\\njudgment, to object to the state’s initial of-\\nfer of a predicate, force an en camera\\nhearing, and then insist that the state must\\nshow before the jury that the statement\\nwas admissible, because as defendant’s\\ncounsel here stated, when the state started\\n\\n“to prove the predicate, “Judge, that is not\\na jury issue.” I agree with him. Admissi-\\nbility is not a jury issue,\\n\\nJONES, Justice (dissenting) :\\n\\nI respectfully-dissent. I would state the\\nissue thusly: Must the State in a criminal\\nprosecution, as a predicate to admissibility,\\nprove the voluntariness of a confession and\\nthe existence of a Miranda warning in the\\npresence of the jury after it has success-\\nfully established voluntariness and Miranda\\nwarnings to the trial Judge en camera?\\n\\nBy affirming the Court of Criminal Ap-\\npeals’ reversal of the conviction in this\\ncase, the majority of this Court has over-\\nturned the traditional distinction between\\nadmissibility and credibility of a confes-\\nsion; and, by destroying this distinction,\\nAlabama now stands alone, as far as I can\\ndetermine, in fashioning a hybrid rule for\\nadmissibility of confessions: At the de-\\nfendant’s insistence, the State must first\\novercome the presumption against volun-\\ntariness en camera and then this predicate\\nto admissibility must again be proved be-\\n\\nfore the jury. The majority says that such\\nproof the second time around is in order\\nfor the jury to weigh its credibility; but\\nadmissibility, not credibility, is the only is-\\nsue raised by the objection (grounded on\\nlack of proper predicate) at the time the\\nconfession is offered into evidence before\\nthe jury.\\n\\nWhile its utility may be of doubtful val-\\nue in the context of a dissenting opinion, it\\nis at least interesting to review briefly the\\nlegal and factual background against which\\nthe dispositive question in this appeal\\narose. A good beginning is the excellent\\nstatement of the rule in the early case of\\nRedd v. State, 69 Ala. 255:\\n\\n“Tt is a well established maxim of the\\nlaw, that the admissibility of evidence is\\nalways a question to be determined by\\nthe court, and its weight or credibility is\\nfor the determination of the jury. It is\\nfor the court, therefore, to say whether\\nthe confessions of a prisoner are volun-\\ntary or involuntary, and this question\\nbeing judicially settled can not be re-\\nviewed by the jury. Hence a charge is\\nerroneous which submits to them the de-\\ncision of this legal question, and should\\nfor that reason, be refused.\\n\\n“There is no conflict whatever be-\\ntween this principle and the further one,\\nwhich is equally well settled, that after\\nthe confessions, in a given case, have\\nbeen admitted, the jury may consider the\\ncircumstances under which the confes-\\nsions were obtained, and the appliances\\nby which they were elicited, including\\nthe situation and mutual relation of the\\nparties, in exercising their exclusive pre-\\nrogative of determining the credibility of\\nthe evidence, or the weight to which it is\\nproperly entitled in controlling the for-\\n\\n. mation of the verdict . .\\n\\nUnder this so-called orthodox rule, the\\nadinissibility-credibility distinction was pre-\\nserved through instruction to the jury\\n\\n\\n357\\n\\nsince the voluntariness predicate—though\\ninvoking a pure legal ruling on admissibili-\\nty—was taken before’ the jury in the same\\nmanner as all other proof. Subsequent\\nfederal case law development (notably Mi-\\nranda and Jackson) added two constitu-\\ntional dimensions to Alabama’s “presump-\\ntion against voluntariness” rule: First, ad-\\nditional rights were included in the warn-\\ning (e. g., right of counsel); and, second\\nen camera proceedings were required to in-\\nsure against irradicable prejudice to the\\ndefendant in the event the predicate was\\nruled legally insufficient to admit the con-\\nfession into evidence.\\n\\nIn the pre-preliminary inquiry era, then\\nthe defendant could not avail himself of\\nthe involuntariness presumption - without\\nnecessarily casting on the state the burden\\nof proving to the Court and before the\\njury, as a predicate to the admission of the\\nconfession, the circumstance under which\\nthe confession was obtained. The presen-\\ntation of this predicate before the jury was\\npurely incidental to the pre-Jackson single\\nproceeding which then existed, While the\\nJury’s limited prerogative to weigh the\\nconfession and its attendant circumstances,\\nand not to judge its competence, was care-\\nfully circumscribed by thorough instruc-\\ntions, this single proceeding ‘system forced\\nthe defendant to risk dual prejudice: First,\\nthe jury heard confession evidence prior to\\na competence ruling by the Court; and,\\nsecond, and just as potentially prejudicial,\\nthe confession may be given undue empha-\\nsis and weight by the State’s compliance\\nwith the predicate requirement. Jackson’s\\nen camera requisite cured the first prob-\\nlem. . Before we proceed with an analysis\\nof the second point, a brief statement of\\nthe factual context of the instant review\\nmay be helpful.\\n\\nThe record shows that the defendant, at\\nthe first hint of the State’s offer of a\\npredicate for the admission of the confes-\\nsion, objected on the ground that this was\\na matter for the Court, not for the jury.\\n\\n* Acting upon this appropriate objection, and\\n\\nthe State’s concurrence therein, the trial\\nCourt then recessed the jury and heard\\ntestimony en camera on the voluntariness\\nissue for two hours. After holding the\\nconfession competent, the trial Court re-\\nconvened the jury and the State offered\\nthe defendant’s confession. Defendant\\nagain objected to its admission before the\\njury on the stated ground that the proper\\npredicate had not been laid.\\n\\nThe purpose of the objection at this\\npoint was in the exercise of abundance of\\nprecaution to preserve for review the trial\\nCourt’s ruling on admissibility; that is, the\\ndefendant did not want to risk his failure\\nto object as constituting a waiver of his\\nprevious objection. The trial Court’s rul-\\ning, consistent with his en camera indica-\\ntion, was a statement for the record in the\\nmain proceeding upholding the legal com-\\npetency of the confession,\\n\\nThe majority opinion holds that the trial\\nCourt erred in not sustaining this objec-\\ntion. Thus, this enigma: Does the majori-\\nty mean that the trial Court should have\\nchanged its mind and ruled differently\\nthan earlier indicated en camera? Or,\\nshould the trial Court have shared its ad-\\nmissibility prerogative with the jury?\\nActually, it is not the intent of the major\\nty to do either; but I have posed this al-\\nternative inquiry to make a point. The\\nmajority opinion states: “Under the ra-\\ntionale of [Duncan & Jackson], how can\\nthe jury consider ‘the voluntariness as af-\\nfecting the weight or credibility of the\\nconfession’ unless the state presents evi-\\ndence as to the ‘Miranda’ and ‘voluntari-\\nness’ predicates to the jury?” This pre-\\nsupposes one of two things: Either the de-\\nfendant will invariably prefer to have the\\nState prove before the jury the circum-\\nstances surrounding the confession; or, by\\nobjecting, the defendant can preclude such\\nproof. The first condition is ruled out,\\nand rightly so, by the majority’s observa-\\ntion “that defense counsel may decide for\\n\\n\\n358\\n\\nreasons of trial strategy it would not be\\ndesirable, from defendant’s standpoint, to\\nrehash this evidence before the jury.”\\n\\nWe now look at the second supposition\\nthat the defendant, by timely objection,\\nmay preclude the State from bolstering the\\nconfession by showing the surrounding cir-\\ncumstances. If it is error for the trial\\nCourt to overrule Defendant objection to\\nthe introduction of the confession on the\\nground of lack of the voluntariness predi-\\ncate, how, then, could it be error to over-\\ntule the defendant’s object to the State’s\\noffer of such proof. If this predicate can\\nbe insisted upon by the defendant, then\\nsurely the State would have the right to\\nmake such proof over the defendant’s\\nobjection. A contrary conclusion would\\nproduce the oddity of rendering either\\nchoice (to prove or not to prove the predi-\\nycate) subject to the objection by the de-\\nfendant.\\n\\nI will now make a final point in the con-\\ntext of a comment on the Mississippi\\n(Rhone) and Iowa (Holland) cases cited by\\nthe majority. Neither of these cases ad-\\ndresses itself to the issue before us. Sure-\\nly, there should be no question in anyone’s\\nmind that the defendant has the unquali-\\nfied right to attack the credibility of a con-\\nfession ruled competent by the Court and\\nadmitted into evidence before the jury.\\nNeither case held (or addressed by way of\\ndictum) whether the trial Court would\\nhave erred in requiring the state to prove\\nthe voluntariness predicate before the jury.\\nTo be sure, there is dictum to the effect\\nthat either party has the right to submit\\nsuch proof, With this I disagree. To\\navoid one of the inherent potentials for\\nprejudice, as earlier discussed, I would lim-\\nit this right to the defendant—permitting\\nthe State to preface the offer of a confes-\\nsion or inculpatory statement, first ruled\\ncompetent by the trial Court, with words to\\nthe effect, “Officer, after warning the de-\\nfendant of his constitutional right, did he\\nmake a statement?”\\n\\nIn the trial of the instant case, the de-\\nfendant, on direct and cross examination\\nof the police officers who heard the de-\\nfendant’s confession, explored the circum-\\nstances under which the confession was\\nmade. On cross examination, the defense\\nattorney emphasized the violent nature of\\npolice arrest procedures when they “bust\\nsome citizen’s door open,” and he por-\\ntrayed the panic and confusion within the\\ndefendant’s apartment after the police had\\nentered. This evidence was admissible be-\\ncause it bore upon the credibility of the\\nconfession. Following such an examina-\\ntion, the prosecution could elect to counter\\nthis attack on credibility by introducing the\\nevidence of Miranda warnings and volun-\\ntariness to offset the defendant’s presenta-\\ntion. Under the majority opinion of this\\nCourt of the Court of Criminal Appeals’\\ninterpretation of the Johnson case, the\\nprosecution would put the trial Court in er-\\nror by not presenting as strong a case\\nagainst the defendant as possible. I do not\\nbelieve this is the law of Johnson. I,\\ntherefore, would reverse the judgment of\\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals and remand\\nto the Court of Criminal Appeals for af-\\nfirmance of the conviction of the trial\\nCourt. ’\\n\\n330 So.2d 417\\nOwen Benson SPARKS\\n\\nv\\nKelly Kirk MILLIGAN.\\nSC 1192,\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\n‘April 2, 1976,\\n\\n\\nTompkins & Tompkins, Tuscumbia, for\\nappellant.\\n\\nSee also 51 Ala.App. 444, 286 So.2d\\n849.\\n\\n\\nO’Bannon & Gonce, and Walker & Mus-\\ngrove, Florence, for appellee.\\n\\nALMON, Justice.\\n\\nThis appeal involves one of two cases\\nwhich arose from an automobile-truck col-\\nlision which occurred on a public road in\\nColbert County.

It is the judgment\\nin the second case from which this appeal\\nis taken,\\n\\nThe appellant, Owen Benson Sparks, was\\nsixty-eight years old. He had no sight in\\nhis left eye and wore glasses for his right\\neye. Having lived in the neighborhood\\nsince 1915, he was familiar with the road\\nwhere the collision occurred.\\n\\nAppellant was driving a 1971 Ford auto-\\nmobile. His brother, Elmore P. Sparks,\\nsince deceased, owned the automobile and\\nwas riding on the right front seat.\\n\\nAppellant testified that he was driving\\nnorth on Allsboro Road at approximately\\n45 miles per hour. As he came over a hill,\\nhe saw an object in the highway about 70\\nyards ahead but could not distinguish what\\nit was.\\n\\nAppellee testified that on the day of the\\naccident he had delivered a load of con-\\ncrete to the John S. Harris residence. He\\nthen drove back onto the Allsboro Road\\nand drove the concrete truck in a northerly\\ndirection for approximately 90 feet before\\n\\n\\n361\\n\\npulling over to the right side of the road\\nto rinse the wet concrete from the trough\\non the back of the truck.\\n\\nThough in dispute, the evidence indicates\\nthat at least the left half of the truck re-\\nmained on the paved portion of the high-\\nway.\\n\\nAppellee was standing at the rear of the\\ntruck at the moment appellant was ap-\\nproaching. Appellant’s automobile struck\\nappellee first and then collided with the\\nrear of the truck. Appellant testified that\\nhe did not know what he hit until after the\\naccident. He further testified that he did\\nnot see appellee until after the accident.\\n\\nA licensed civil engineer testified on be-\\nhalf of appellee, using a projection of the\\nmiddle of the carport of the Harris resi-\\ndence as a base line, that fifty per cent of\\nan object 11’ 1” high (the height of the\\ntruck) 90 feet north of the base line could\\nbe seen 776 feet south of the base line. Es-\\nsentially, all of an object 11’ 1” high could\\nbe seen 500 feet south of the base line.\\n\\nFollowing the accident, the investigating\\nstate trooper took appellant to the rear of\\nthe automobile he had been operating. Ap-\\npellant could not read the numbers on the\\ntag until he was 48 feet from the rear of\\nthe automobile.\\n\\nHM Appellant argues that it was error\\nfor the trial court to allow the wanton\\ncount to be submitted to the jury.\\n\\n‘This court defined wantonness in Griffin\\nLumber Co. v. Harper, 247 Ala. 616, 618,\\n25 So.2d $05, 506 (1946), as follows:\\n\\n“Wantonness is the conscious doing of\\nsome act or omission of some duty under\\nknowledge of existing conditions and\\nconscious that from the doing of such\\nact or omission of such duty injury will\\nlikely or probably result.”\\n\\nIn Jackson v.

Appellant was sixty-eight years old at\\nthe time of the trial,\\n\\n2. Appellant was familiar with the road\\nwhere the accident occurred, having lived\\nin the vicinity since 1915.\\n\\n3. Appellant had, on numerous occasions\\nseen slow moving or stopped traffic on the\\nroad,\\n\\n4, Appellant was blind in his left eye\\nand required glasses for his right eye.\\n\\n5. The accident occurred during the day-\\ntime on a clear day.\\n\\n6. The concrete truck was 7 11” in\\nwidth and 11’ 1” in height.\\n\\n7. A civil engineer testified that one-half\\nof the truck could have been seen by appel-\\nlant when his automobile was 776 feet\\nfrom the truck and that the entire truck\\ncould have been seen when appellant’s au-\\ntomobile was 500 feet from the truck.\\n\\n8. Appellant testified that he was not\\nsure whether he slowed down or attempted\\nto avoid the truck,\\n\\n9. There was room for the automobile to\\ngo around the truck on the paved portion\\nof the highway.\\n\\nWe are not persuaded that the wanton\\ncount was unsupported by the evidence.\\n\\nAppellant next argues that the trial\\ncourt erred in reading to the jury, as part\\nof the oral charge, the last part of Tit. 36,\\n§ 25(a), Code of Alabama 1940, Recom-\\npiled 1958. Appellant submits that the court\\nerred again in re-reading § 25(a) when the\\njury asked for additional instructions.\\n\\n\\n362\\n\\nTit. 36, § 25(a) provides that:\\n\\n“No person shall park or leave stand-\\ning any vehicle, whether attended or un-\\nattended, upon the paved or improved or\\nmain traveled portion of any highway,\\noutside of a business or residence dis-\\ntrict, when it is practicable to park or\\nleave such vehicle standing off of the\\npaved or improved or main traveled por-\\ntion of such highway; provided, in no\\nevent shall any person park or leave\\nstanding any vehicle, whether attended,\\nor unattended, upon any highway unless\\na clear and unobstructed width of not\\nless than fifteen feet upon the main\\ntraveled portion of said highway oppo-\\nsite such standing vehicle shall be left\\n\\nfor free passage of other vehicles there- *\\n\\non, nor unless a clear view of such vehi-\\ncle may be obtained from a distance of\\ntwo hundred feet in each direction upon\\nsuch highway.”\\n\\nThe second part of the statute (which\\nbegins after the semicolon) is considered a\\nproviso. Campbell v. Jackson, 257 Ala.\\n618, 623, 60 So,2d 252, 256 (1952). “The\\nproviso is operative only where it is im-\\npracticable to park or stop off the main\\ntraveled portion of the highway, and in no-\\nwise strikes out the requirement that the\\nvehicle be left off the improved portion, if\\npracticable.” Campbell v. Jackson, supra.\\n\\nHM Appellant argues that only the first\\npart of § 25(a) should have been given to\\nthe jury because under appellant’s con-\\nstruction of the evidence it was practicable\\nfor appellee Milligan to have left the con-\\ncrete truck entirely off the paved portion\\nof the highway.\\n\\nWe consider this argument somewhat\\nhyper-technical. Clearly, the subject of\\n\\nthe statute in toto deals with leaving vehi-\\ncles on highways.\\n\\nState Trooper Mitchell testified that the\\nhighway was approximately 22 feet wide.\\nThus, there is some question as to whether\\nthere remained 15 feet opposite the stand-\\ning truck. If the jury had concluded that\\nless than 15 feet remained, then certainly\\nthat fact would have tended to show negli-\\ngence on the part of appellee and could\\nhave been favorable to appellant on his\\nplea of contributory negligence. The trial\\njudge may have very well had this in mind\\nwhen he charged the entirety of § 25(a).\\n\\nHl This argument of appellant dealing\\nwith the issue of contributory negligence\\nof appellee must be predicated on the sup-\\nposition that the jury made its award of\\ndamages on the theory of negligence rather\\nthan wantonness. We are not permitted to\\nengage in this supposition. The jury re-\\nturned a general verdict without reference\\nto either count. With the record in this\\nposture the verdict will be referred to ei-\\nther of the counts that are supported by\\nthe evidence. Thrasher v. Darnell, 275\\nAla. 570, 156 So.2d 922; Super X Drugs\\nof Alabama, Inc. v. Martz, 51 Ala.App.\\n370, 286 So.2d 47; Champion v.

Minton\\nd/b/a Valley Paging from judgment of the\\nCircuit Court of Montgomery County\\nwhich affirmed an Order of the Alabama\\nPublic Service Commission. The Order\\ngranted a Certificate of Public Conven-\\nience and Necessity to Phenix Communica-\\ntions Company, Inc. The Certificate au-\\nthorized Phenix to operate.a one-way sig-\\nnaling (paging) service and two-way com-\\nmunication service (by radio) in Russell\\nCounty and a portion of Lee County. The\\nCertificate is required by the Alabama Ra-\\ndio Utility Act. Code of Ala., Tit. 48, §\\n355(9) et seq. Minton filed a protest with\\nAPSC to the application of Phenix for the\\nCertificate. He appealed to the Montgom-\\nery Circuit Court from the grant of it by\\n\\n_ filing complaint in that court per statute.\\nIt alleged the Order of APSC granting the\\nCertificate was in violation of Code of\\nAla, Tit. 48, § 355(19), and unlawful.\\n\\nWe reverse.\\n\\n‘The Issue\\n\\nThe sole issue presented for review de-\\nterminative of the result on this appeal is:\\nMay Certificates of Convenience and Ne-\\ncessity be held by competing radio utilities\\nentitling each to offer the same service, in\\nthe same area, when one held a grant of\\nauthority antecedent to another and there\\nhad been no determination that the holder\\nof the prior grant had generated operation\\nof Code of Ala., Tit. 48, § 355(19)? We\\nanswer in the negative.\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\n(A) “One-way” signaling can be de-\\nscribed as one-way communication (by ra-\\ndio transmitter) to a radio receiver for the\\npurpose of actuating a signaling device on\\n\\n1, Until 20 September 1972, no regulations\\nhad been promulgated by APSC making dis-\\ntinction between one-way signaling on a pri-\\n\\nsuch receiver or for communicating a mes-\\nsage to such receiver.\\n\\n(B) “Two-way” (radio) communication\\ncan be described as radio transmission to,\\nby voice or signal, and reception by radio\\nreceiver of such voice or signal transmis-\\nsion and the converse of that process.\\n\\n(C) “Primary basis,” for the purposes\\nof this case, can be described as the prior-\\nity allowed one-way signaling conducted\\non a “paging only” channel over a trans-\\nmitter being utilized in a two-way com-\\nmunications operation,\\n\\n(D) “Secondary basis,’ for the pur-\\nposes of this case, can be described as\\none-way signaling permitted over a trans-\\nmitter being utilized in a two-way commu-\\nnications operation but which is prohibited\\nwhile two-way communications are being\\nconducted over the channel. Such signal-\\ning is, therefore, subordinate and second-\\nary to two-way communications.\\n\\nThe Facts\\n\\nThe record contains evidence from\\nwhich the following facts may be dis-\\ncerned:\\n\\nIn August 1971, Minton filed application\\nwith the Federal Communications Commis-\\nsion (FCC) for authority to conduct a\\none-way signaling service in Phenix City,\\nAlabama. On 22 September 1971, Phenix\\nprotested that application. On 28 Septem-\\nber 1971, the Alabama Radio Utility Act\\nbecame law. On 1 March 1972, APSC\\ngranted Phenix authority for one-way sig-\\nnaling and two-way communication service.\\nOn 23 March 1972, the Certificate granting\\nthat authority was amended by APSC to\\nlimit one-way signaling by Phenix to con-\\nducting it “on a secondary basis only.”\\nThis was effected as a result of petition\\nfiled by Phenix.\\n\\nmary basis and that done on a secondary\\nbasis.\\n\\n\\nOn 9 August 1972, Minton was granted a\\nCertificate of authority by APSC for one-\\nway signaling (paging) on a primary basis.\\nPhenix, which for several years had been\\noperating a signaling (paging) service on a\\nsecondary basis, appealed from that grant\\nto him by filing complaint in the Circuit\\nCourt of Montgomery County. That court\\naffirmed the decision of APSC granting\\nMinton the Certificate authorizing him to\\noffer the radio utility service for which he\\nhad applied. Phenix took no appeal from\\nthat decision.\\n\\nOn 7 March 1973, Phenix filed an appli-\\ncation seeking to be certificated by APSC\\nfor operation of a one-way signaling serv-\\nice on a primary basis in the area already\\nbeing serviced by Minton. At the time of\\n\\napplication by Phenix, Minton had some-\\n\\nfive customers using a total of fourteen\\npaging devices.\\n\\nThe APSC held a hearing on Phenix’s\\napplication, Phenix presented testimony of\\ntwo of its customers, already receiving sec-\\nondary paging service, Their testimony\\nindicated a willingness to accept primary\\npaging service provided Phenix could offer\\nsuch service. However, they were not\\nwilling to change to another radio utility to\\nobtain the advantages of primary paging.\\nThey had been offered a primary paging\\nservice by Minton and had refused such\\nservice,\\n\\nOn 24 May 1974, after this hearing, an\\nOrder of APSC was entered granting the\\napplication and issuing Phenix a Certifi-\\ncate of authority to operate one-way sig-\\nnaling (paging) service. A portion of that\\nOrder made the following finding:\\n\\n«* * * Protestant, Robert E. Min-\\nton d/b/a Valley Paging presently holds\\na Certificate of Public Convenience and\\nNecessity to operate a one-way signaling\\nservice in the same area as that request-\\ned by Applicant. This Certificate was\\ngranted to Valley Paging on August 9,\\n1972, under Docket No. 16564.”\\n\\nMinton was never given notice of, nor was\\nhe afforded, a hearing so that APSC\\nimight determine that he, who already held\\na Certificate as one for which Phenix was\\napplying, was\\n\\n“* * * (1) unwilling or unable to\\n\\nmeet the reasonable needs of the public,\\nand (2) that the person [Minton] oper-\\nating the same [service] is unable to or\\ntefuses or neglects after hearing on rea-\\nsonable notice to provide reasonably ade-\\nquate service.” Code of Ala., Tit. 48, §\\n355(19).\\n\\nThe Decision\\n\\nHH Code of Ala., Tit. 48, § 82, permits\\nthe trial court and this court to set aside\\nan Order of APSC only if it finds (1) the\\nOrder was procured by fraud, or (2) the\\nOrder was based upon findings of fact\\ncontrary to the substantial weight of the\\nevidence, or (3) appellant’s substantial\\nrights were prejudiced by the Commission’s\\nmisapplication of the law to the facts. ‘Al-\\nabama Public Service Commission v. Coop-\\ner Transfer Company, Inc., 295 Ala. —,\\n326 So.2d 283; Alabama Public Service\\nCommission v. Higginbotham, 256 Ala. 621,\\n56 So.2d 401.\\n\\nIM In this case (1) and (2) have no\\narea of applicability. Number (3) collides\\nwith the Order when the finding in that Or-\\nder, to which we previously alluded, dem-\\nonstrates that Phenix was certificated in\\nspite of the Commission’s failure to comply\\n\\nwith Tit. 48, § 355(19). That was the\\npoint at which Minton’s substantial rights\\nwere prejudiced by the grant to Phenix of\\nits Certificate without applying § 355(19)\\nto the proved fact; Minton’s then extant\\nCertificate. The grant was, therefore, in\\ndirect violation of law. The trial court\\nfailed to reverse APSC for its error. We\\nmust.\\n\\nThe judgment of the Circuit Court of\\nMontgomery County affirming the action\\n\\n\\n366\\n\\nof the Alabama Public Service Commission\\nis hereby reversed as is the Order of that\\nCommission granting Phenix Communica-\\ntions Company, Inc. its Certificate of Pub-\\nlic Convenience and Necessity permitting\\noperation by it of a one-way paging or sig-\\nnaling service on a primary basis.

J. Rehling, one of\\nthe parties against whom the injunction\\nwas soughtt An amicus curiae brief has\\nalso been submitted in support of the ap-\\npeal by certain third parties who are the\\ndefendants in a wrongful death action in-\\nstituted by Mrs. Carr, seeking to recover\\ndamages for the death of her husband.\\n\\nMrs. Carr’s husband was killed on June\\n4, 1975, when his automobile ran under the\\ntrailer of a tractor trailer truck. This col-\\nlision caused a severe head injury to Mr.\\nCarr, which apparently caused his death.\\nDeputy County Coroner Parker, who was\\ncalled to the scene of the collision, deter-\\nmined that Mr. Carr met his death as a re-\\nsult of injuries received in the accident.\\nMr. Carr’s body was removed to a local\\nhospital where a further examination of\\nthe body was made and a blood sample was\\ndrawn from the deceased’s heart by Parker.\\nParker sent this blood sample to the State\\nToxicologist for an alcohol content analy-\\nsis.\\n\\nOn June 16, 1975, Mrs. Carr’s bill for\\ndeclaratory judgment and an injunction\\nwas filed naming as defendants Deputy\\nCoroner Parker and State Toxicologist\\nRehling. The motion alleged that the\\nblood sample was illegally obtained and\\nthat irreparable injury would occur if the\\nsample were not immediately returned to\\nMrs. Carr. The preliminary injunction\\nwas granted without notice on the day of\\nits filing.\\n\\nAfter a hearing at which both defend-\\nants Parker and Rehling were represented,\\na final decree was rendered on August 5,\\n1975, granting summary judgment in favor\\nof Mrs, Carr. The trial court ruled that\\nParker’s actions in taking the blood sample\\nwere unauthorized and that the submission\\nof the blood sample to the State Toxicolo-\\ngist was also unauthorized, The decree\\nordered the return of the blood sample\\n\\n1, Although the Deputy Coroner took an ap-\\npeal in this cause, we were advised in brief\\nthat ne has dismissed it,\\n\\nWe find no record\\n\\nto. Mrs, Carr and prohibited any public\\nrecording of the results of the blood sample\\ntests.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on July 15, 1975, Mrs. Carr\\nfiled suit against E. E, Mooney and B.\\nManess claiming damages in the amount of\\n$300,000 for the wrongful death of Mrs,\\nCarr’s husband. In their amicus curiae\\nbrief, Mooney and Maness allege that they\\nhad no notice of the injunction proceed-\\nings, until after the final decree was is-\\nsued. They state that they did not learn of\\nthe injunction until December, 1975, when\\ntheir attorneys, in the course of preparing\\nfor trial in the wrongful death action, re-\\nquested information from the State Toxi-\\ncologist’s office concerning the analysis of\\nthe blood sample taken from the deceased.\\nCounsel for Mooney and Maness were then\\ninformed that the release of such informa-\\ntion was prohibited by injunction. They\\nmaintain that evidence of the alcohol con-\\ntent of the blood of the deceased is ex-\\ntremely material to the issue of their liabil-\\nity in the wrongful death action. .\\n\\nOn this appeal, State Toxicologist Rehl-\\ning argues that Mrs. Carr sought the in-\\njunction for the purpose of restricting\\nMooney’s and Maness’ access to the blood\\nalcohol analysis of the deceased’s blood for\\npurposes of their defense in the wrongful\\ndeath action. Rehling contends that to ob-\\ntain an injunction for the purpose of sup-\\npressing evidence of this nature constitutes\\nan abuse of the judicial process, and con-\\nstitutes an impermissible interference with\\na public officer’s exercise of duties within\\nhis discretion or judgment.\\n\\nIn response, appellee Carr contends that\\nthe coroner’s statutorily-conferred authori-\\nty was exceeded by taking the blood sam-\\nple. Appellee argues that the deceased’s\\nfatal head injury made his cause of death\\nobvious and, therefore that the blood anal-\\nysis in this case was improper. Appellee\\ncontends that as the spouse of the deceased\\n\\nthereof in the transcript but both parties\\ntreat his dismissal as having been effected,\\nand so do we,\\n\\n\\n369\\n\\nshe is entitled to the custody of the body,\\nand parts of the body, of her deceased hus-\\nband.\\n\\nI There is no authority of which we\\nare aware, or of which we have been ad-\\nvised, authorizing a coroner or deputy cor-\\noner to take a blood sample from a de-\\nceased as was done in this case.\\n\\nTit. 15, § 76, Code 1940, authorizes a\\ncoroner to impanel a coroner’s jury and to\\nmake inquiry of the facts and circum-\\nstances of the death of a person when he\\n“has been informed that a person has been\\nkilled, or suddenly died under such circum-\\nstances as to afford a reasonable ground\\nfor belief that such death has been occa-\\nsioned by the act of another by unlawful\\nmeans, . . ..” This section does not\\nauthorize the taking of the blood sample by\\nthe deputy coroner in this case.\\n\\nTit. 36, § 154, Code 1940, as amended\\n[Tit. 36, § 154, Code 1958, Recompiled] the\\n“Implied Consent Law” states :\\n\\n“(a) Any person who operates a mo-\\ntor vehicle upon the public highways of\\nthis state shall be deemed to have given\\nhis consent, subject to the provisions of\\nthis chapter, to a chemical test or tests\\nof his blood, breath or urine for the pur-\\npose of determining the alcoholic content\\nof his blood if lawfully arrested for any\\noffense arising out of acts alleged to\\nhave been committed while the person\\nwas driving a motor vehicle on the pub-\\nlic highways of this state while under\\nthe influence of intoxicating liquor.\\n\\n”\\n\\n“(b) Any person who is dead, uncon-\\nscious or who is otherwise in a condition\\nrendering him incapable of refusal, shall\\nbe deemed not to have withdrawn the\\nconsent provided by paragraph (a) of\\nthis section and the test or tests may be\\nadministered, subject to the provisions of\\nthis chapter.”\\n\\nBut, Tit. 36, § 155, supra, states:\\nDe\\n\\n“(c) Only a_ physician, registered\\nnurse, or duly licensed clinical laboratory\\ntechnologist or clinical laboratory techni-\\ncian acting at the request of a law en-\\nforcement officer may withdraw blood\\nfor the purpose of determining the alco-\\nholic content therein. This limitation\\nshall not apply to the taking of breath or\\nurine specimens.”\\n\\nThus, neither of these sections authorize\\nthe deputy coroner to do what he did in\\nthe case before us. Nothing appears in the\\nrecord to indicate that the deputy coroner\\nfalls within any of the classes of persons\\nset out in § 155, Tit. 36, supra.\\n\\nHE We must then conclude that, hav-\\ning no statutory right to withdraw the\\nblood sample in question, the coroner’s act\\nwas unauthorized. The blood sample,\\nbeing a part of the remains of the de-\\nceased, is due to be returned to the surviv-\\ning spouse (the plaintiff-appellee here)\\nwho has a paramount right thereto.

(Dumas Brothers) and against defend-\\nant Samuel T. Dumas, Jr., d/b/a Samuel\\nDumas Construction Company (Dumas).\\n\\nWe affirm.\\n\\n.\\n\\nThe Pleadings\\n\\nThe action for damages arose from de-\\nstruction by fire of a building and its con-\\ntents of furniture products, raw materials,\\nsupplies and equipment, all incident to\\nplaintiffs furniture manufacturing bust\\nness,\\n\\nBy its last amended complaint Dumas\\nBrothers asserted the right to recover of\\nDumas for breach of duties arising from\\nthe relationship of the parties under an\\noral agreement whereby Dumas undertook\\nconstruction of additions to premises of\\nDumas Brothers.\\n\\nThe breach of those duties was said to\\nconsist of negligence in causing the de-\\nstructive fire by: (1) failing’ to warn a\\nworkman of the presence of highly flam-\\nmable material at a place where defendant\\nknew or should have known it to be and\\ncausing or permitting that workman to use\\na burning torch (to burn or cut metal) in\\nclose proximity to that material. (2) De-\\nfendant Dumas using or causing the torch\\nto be used at the same place after defend-\\nant Dumas had been warned by plaintiff,\\nDumas Brothers against such use.\\n\\nIssue was joined by answer. It was a\\ndenial (general issue) of the material alle-\\ngations of the complaint and alleged con-\\ntributory negligence upon the part of Du-\\nmas Brothers,\\n\\nDumas filed Motion for Directed Ver-\\ndict on conclusion of the evidence. It was\\ndenied. Following verdict he filed Motion\\nFor Judgment Notwithstanding The Ver-\\ndict, or in the alternative, Motion For New\\nTrial. After a hearing of the latter mo-\\ntion, at which evidence was taken, the mo-\\ntion was denied. This appeal ensued.\\n\\n\\n373\\n\\nThe Facts\\n\\nDefendant Dumas entered into an oral\\nagreement with plaintiff Dumas Brothers\\nto make additions to a warehouse owned\\nby the latter.. Dumas was aware of the\\nnature of the business (manufacture of\\nfurniture) engaged in by Dumas Brothers,\\nthe highly flammable nature of foam rub-\\nber used in that business and that such was\\nstored in the warehouse to which he was\\nmaking additions. Under the terms of the\\nrather loosely defined oral agreement it\\nappears there was an understanding that\\nfrom time to time during construction Du-\\nmas could call upon Dumas Brothers for\\nhelp from its employees, if needed, al-\\nthough any such employee would remain in\\nthe pay of Dumas Brothers.\\n\\nThe fire, the vortex of controversy in\\nthis case, originated in the ceiling of. a\\nbuilding to which an addition was being\\nconstructed. Its cause was sparks falling\\nfrom the site of a cut being made in metal\\n\\nby use of a cutting torch. Those sparks .\\n\\nfell upon highly flammable foam rubber\\nstored in the existing building. The torch\\nwas being used at the time by Jimmy\\nBayles who was on the payroll of Dumas\\nBrothers, Dumas was there doing the cut-\\nting at the particular spot using a cutting\\ntorch under the following circumstances.\\nWhen Dumas had embarked upon the job\\nhe was told by Dumas Brothers that it had\\na qualified welder and burner and that\\nanytime he needed one to send and get\\nhim, not to hire one. Before the time at\\nwhich the fire started Dumas had been told\\nby Dumas Brothers not to use a cutting\\ntorch or cutting tool to cut the metal\\nbeams near the foam rubber.\\n\\nBayles had been sent to Dumas for the\\npurpose of cutting with a torch upon Du-\\nmas’ request for “* * * a man with a\\ntorch to do some burning.” Dumas did not\\ninform Dumas Brothers of the location of\\nthe spot where the “burning” was to be\\ndone—on the beam adjacent to where the\\nfoam rubber was stored in the warehouse.\\nDumas Brothers was not otherwise in-\\n\\nformed that such “burning” or cutting was\\nto be at that spot. Dumas instructed\\nBayles where to cut. Dumas then left the\\nsitus of the cutting and was not present\\nwhen the fire started. The facts recited in\\nthe foregoing summary were adduced from\\nsharply conflicting evidence in the record\\nabout which there is heated disagreement\\nexpressed by the parties in their respective\\nbriefs.\\n\\nThe Issues\\n\\nThe assignments of error present for re-\\nview these issues: (A) On a hearing of\\nthe motion for judgment notwithstanding\\nthe verdict, or in the alternative for new\\ntrial, was it error to exclude an affidavit\\nand testimony of a juror offered to im-\\npeach the verdict? (B) Did the giving of\\ncertain written jury instructions at the in-\\nstance of Dumas Brothers injuriously af-\\nfect the substantial rights of Dumas?\\n(C) Did prejudicial error result from the\\nfailure of the trial court to hear and re-\\ncord the testimony of a juror offered to\\nimpeach the verdict?\\n\\nThere were other errors assigned but not\\nurged, therefore we will not deal wit\\nthem. .\\n\\nA\\n\\nOn hearing of his motion for judgment\\nn. 0. v. or in the alternative for a new\\ntrial, Dumas offered the affidavit of a ju-\\nror. In pertinent part it reads:\\n\\n“* * * Twas a member of the jury\\nin the case of Dumas Brothers Manufac-\\nturing Company, Inc., Vs, Samuel T.\\nDumas, Jr. d/b/a Samuel T. Dumas\\nConstruction Company, which case was\\ntried in the Circuit Court of Clarke\\nCounty, Alabama, during the week of\\nFebruary 4, 1975. After the case was\\ncompleted and we went to the jury room\\nto decide the case, the discussion in the\\njury room was about insurance and that\\nSamuel Dumas, the defendant, would not\\nbe hurt by any verdict which we might\\nreturn against him for damages. The\\nfacts of the case were not discussed and\\n\\n\\n374\\n\\nthere was no discussion about Samuel\\nDumas being negligent or at fault. I did\\nnot and do not believe from the evidence\\nwhich I heard that the fire which result-\\ned in the lawsuit was in anyway the\\nfault of Samuel Dumas. From the dis-\\ncussion about insurance in the jury\\nroom, I was led to believe that Samuel\\nDumas had plenty of insurance coverage\\nand that he would not be liable for any\\npart of the judgment which we returned\\nagainst him, The only reason that I vot-\\ned to return a verdict in the amount of\\n$234,000.00 against Samuel Dumas was\\nbecause of the fact that I believed from\\nthe discussion in the jury room that he\\nhad plenty of insurance coverage.”\\n\\nHl The law and public policy alike de-\\nclare that affidavits of jurors with respect\\nto occurrences in the jury room may not\\nbe received for the purpose of impeaching\\ntheir own verdict. Weekley v. Horn, 263\\nAla. 364, 82 So.2d 341. The basis for the\\nrule is expressed in Gulf States Steel Co.\\nv. Law, 224 Ala. 667, 141 So. 641, as fol-\\nlows:\\n\\n“The court committed no error, when\\nit declined to consider the affidavit of\\none of the jurors trying the case, who\\nundertook to testify to his own and fel-\\nlow jurors’ action and conduct while\\nconsidering the case. A due regard for\\nthe proper and orderly administration of\\nthe law, a proper regard for the solemni-\\nty of verdicts of jurors, as well as a\\nsound public policy forbid that members\\nof a jury, after they have made their de-\\nliverances in court, should be allowed to\\nimpeach their verdicts. To give consid-\\neration to such affidavits would tend to\\nbring the law and its administration into\\ndisrepute, * * *?”\\n\\nquoting from Weekley v. Horn, supra.\\n\\nHE «Dumas contends the trial court\\nerred in not accepting the juror’s affidavit\\nand testimony which exposed jury discus-\\nsions during its deliberation. He says the\\ncase falls within an exception to the gener-\\n\\nal rule. The exception is where the affi-\\ndavit tends to show the extraneous facts\\nwhich have influenced the verdict, Im-\\nproper communications between jurors\\nthemselves are not extraneous influences\\nor ‘extraneous facts. Weekley v. Horn, su-\\npra. Dumas contends that the content of\\nthe affidavit here stating the jury failed to\\ndiscuss the facts in evidence compels by in-\\nference the conclusion that what it dis-\\ncussed was necessarily extraneous facts,\\nWe cannot agree with this,\\n\\nHI The affidavit offered revealed\\nmerely what was discussed during jury de-\\nliberation; liability insurance coverage.\\nThe affidavit was properly excluded. It\\nonly divulged the nature and content of the\\njury’s deliberation. That, without regard\\nto its propriety or lack of it, is not extra-\\nneous.\\n\\nB\\n\\nThe written jury instructions given at\\nthe request of Dumas Brothers about\\nwhich Dumas complains are:\\n\\nNumber Four (4)\\n\\n“The Court charges the jury that in\\ndetermining whether the general employ-\\ner or one to whom the employee has been\\nloaned is responsible for the employee’s\\nacts, he is to be deemed the employer\\nwho has the choice, control and direction\\nof the employee in the service to be per-\\nformed. If the jury is reasonably satis-\\nfied from the evidence in this case that\\nat the time of the occurrence of the fire\\nalleged in the complaint, Jimmy Bayles\\nwas then and there performing duties\\nwhich in all details were according to\\nthe choice of and under the control and\\ndirection of the defendant, Samuel T.\\nDumas, in that event your determination\\n\\n_ Should be that Jimmy Bayles was then\\nand there acting as the employee or\\nservant of the defendant, Samuel T. Du-\\nmas; and the Court further charges you\\nthat if you are reasonably satisfied by\\nthe evidence in this case that alleged fire\\nwas the direct and proximate result of\\nthe negligence of Jimmy Bayles in per-\\n\\n\\nDn 375\\n\\nforming his work at that time and that\\nPlaintiffs damage, as claimed in this\\ncase, proximately resulted from that neg-\\nligence, then your verdict should be for\\nthe plaintiff.”\\n\\nNumber Five (5)\\n\\n“The Court charges the jury that an\\nemployee may be in the general service\\nof one person or firm and nevertheless\\nwith respect to some particular work\\nmay be transferred to the service of an-\\nother person or firm in such way that\\nthe employee becomes, for the time\\nbeing, the servant or employee of such\\nother person or firm. In such cases, in\\ndetermining the question whether the\\nemployee at a particular time is the em-\\nployee of his general employer or that of\\nthe person or firm to whom his services\\nhave been lent, consideration should be\\ngiven to the matter of whose work the\\nemployee is performing and under whose\\ncontrol he is performing that work at\\nthe time in question. It is the right to\\ncontrol the performance of the work at\\nthe time in question that determines the\\nemployer-employee relation.

In support he cites Lucas v. Kirk,\\n275 Ala. 20, 151 So.2d 744. On request of\\nDumas the following written charges were\\ngiven:\\n\\nNumber Two (2)\\n\\n“T charge you that if you are reasona-\\nbly satisfied from the evidence in this\\ncase that Dumas Brothers Manufactur-\\ning Company, Inc, had the reserved\\nright of control over Jimmy Bayles at\\nthe time he was working at the building\\nsite where the fire occurred, then Jimmy\\nBayles was acting within the line and\\nscope of his employment with Dumas\\nBrothers Manufacturing Company, Inc.,\\nat such time.”\\n\\nNumber Three (3)\\n\\n“T charge you that if you are reasona-\\nbly satisfied from the evidence that Du-\\nmas Brothers Manufacturing Company,\\nInc. assumed the duty of providing a\\nperson to operate a torch cutter when\\nneeded by Samuel T.

Dumas, Jr., had the right\\nto assume that Dumas Brothers Manu-\\nfacturing Company, Inc,, would send a\\nperson who was competent and would\\ntake reasonable safety precautions in the\\noperation of a torch cutter.”\\n\\n\\nNumber Five (5)\\n\\n“T charge you that if you are reasona-\\nbly satisfied from the evidence in this\\ncase that Jimmy Bayles was an employee\\nof Dumas Brothers Manufacturing Com-\\npany, Inc., and was working within the\\nline and scope of his employment with\\nDumas Brothers Manufacturing Com-\\npany, Inc., at the time of the incident\\nconcerned, and if you are further rea-\\nsonably satisfied from the evidence in\\nthis case that Jimmy Bayles was guilty of\\nany negligence which proximately con-\\ntributed, even in the slightest degree, to\\nthe fire damage complained of, then you\\ncannot return a verdict against Samuel\\nT. Dumas, Jr.”\\n\\nNumber Thirteen (13)\\n\\n“I charge you that the mere fact that\\nSamuel Dumas gave information and\\ndirections to Jimmy Bayles as to the de-\\ntails of the work or the manner of doing\\nit does not make Jimmy Bayles the serv-\\nant or employee of Samuel Dumas.”\\n\\nNumber Fourteen (14)\\n\\n“I charge you that if you are reasona-\\nbly satisfied from the evidence in this\\ncase that Dumas Brothers Manufactur-\\ning Company, Inc., had the authoritative\\ndirection and control of Jimmy Bayles\\non the occasion concerned, and if you\\nare further reasonably satisfied from the\\nevidence that Samuel Dumas merely sug-\\ngested to Jimmy Bayles the details or the\\nnecessary cooperation for the perform-\\nance of the work furnished, then Jimmy\\nBayles was the employee of Dumas\\nBrothers Manufacturing Company on\\nsuch occasion and was not the employee\\nof Samuel Dumas so as to hold Samuel\\nDumas liable for any negligence on the\\npart of Jimmy Bayles.”\\n\\nIn the court’s oral charge we find:\\n\\n“sk * * who was Jimmy Bayles act-\\ning for as agent on that occasion?\\nWas he acting for the plaintiff, Dumas\\nBrothers Manufacturing Company, or\\n\\n377.\\n\\nwas he acting for the defendant, Samuel\\nT. Dumas, Jr.? And also, if he was\\nacting for either of them, was he acting\\nwithin the line and scope of his employ-\\nment or agency, or acting as agent, serv-\\nant, or employee of his principal.\\n\\n“Now, in connection with agency, the\\nCourt charges you an agent is a person\\nwho by agreement with another, called\\nthe principal, acts for the principal and\\nis subject to his control. This agreement\\nmay be oral or written or implied from\\nthe conduct of the parties, and may be\\nwith or without compensation. * * *\\n\\n* * * * * *\\n\\n“e * * Now, mind you, either one\\ncould be acting through their agents,\\nservants, or employees on that occasion,\\nthe defendant or the plaintiff, and the\\nplaintiff or the defendant, if you find\\nthat this witness, Jimmy Bayles, was an\\nagent then you would have to say who\\nhe was acting for. * * *”\\n\\n[I The specific omissions which result\\nin written charges of Dumas Brothers\\nbeing incurable erroneous statements of\\nlaw, according to Dumas, is the failure to\\nqualify the word “control” by the words\\n“reserved right of” and the failure to in-\\nclude the word “consensual” in describing\\nthe necessary consent, agreement or ac-\\nquiescence of Bayles to be a “loaned serv-\\nant” of Samuel Dumas. Admittedly these\\ncharges may not be the most carefully\\ndrafted, complete and precise statements of\\nthe factors to be considered by the jury in\\ndeciding whether, on the occasion, Bayles\\nwas a “loaned servant” of Dumas. On the\\nother hand when one looks at the totality\\nof the instructions by which the jury was\\nguided in its resolution of this issue then\\nthe claimed defects in them assume Lilli-\\nputian proportions. Lucas is not apt, rath-\\ner is Rule 51, ARCP. Taylor v. Owen,\\n294 Ala. 543, 319 So.2d 672. The totality\\nof the jury instruction, oral and written\\nwas legally sufficient and the evidence ade-\\nquate to authorize the jury to conclude that\\nBayles was the “loaned servant” of Dumas.\\n\\n\\n378 as\\n\\nsible on any ground. Weekley v. Horn,\\n\\nThe ultimate test is whose work was the\\nservant doing at the time the complained\\nof act was committed and under whose con-\\ntrol was he doing it? Martin v. Anniston\\nFoundry Co., 259 Ala. 633, 68 So.2d 323.\\n\\nPlaintiff\\'s and defendant’s given request-\\ned charges taken together and in conjunc-\\ntion with the whole of the court’s oral\\ncharge does not, therefore, constitute re-\\nversible error. Error, if any, is error\\nwithout injury since the charges viewed as\\nan entity did not injuriously affect the sub-\\nstantial rights of Dumas. ARAP 45.\\n\\nc\\n\\nDumas contends the trial court\\nerred in not hearing and recording the tes-\\ntimony of a juror offered to impeach the\\nverdict. He relies on Rule 43(c), ARCP\\nin that part:\\n\\n“* & & the court upon request shall\\n\\ntake and report the evidence in full, un-_\\nless it clearly appears that the evidence’\\n\\nis not admissible on any ground\\nkM\\n\\nThis gives Dumas the opportunity to place\\nin the record what he was not allowed to\\nadduce at the hearing of the post judgment\\nmotion unless “* * * it clearly appears\\nthat the evidence is not admissible on any\\nground * * *.”\\n\\nThe court allowed Dumas to make a\\nshowing of what he expected to prove by\\nthe juror’s testimony, After making that\\noffer by reading the affidavit, counsel for\\nDumas asked the juror:\\n\\n“When you went into the jury room\\nwhat was the topic of discussion, and\\nwhat statements did you hear made in\\nthe jury room?”\\n\\nDumas Brothers immediately objected and\\nthe court correctly sustained that objec-\\ntion.

In our opinion\\nhe was, and we affirm.\\n\\nOn November 21, 1973, S. M. Stone and\\nS. L. Stone filed suit against Eva Mae\\nJones, B, L. Stone, and Sarah J. Stone to\\nsell 40 acres of land at public auction for\\ndivision of the proceeds. The first sale\\nwas held on April 18, 1975. At this sale a\\n\\n379 .\\n\\ndispute arose over the final bid. Mitchell\\nsaid when he bid $4,500, the auctioneer\\nclosed the bidding. Mr. Beck, who repre-\\nsented Sarah Stone, said he made a bid of\\n$5,000. The Register said she could not\\ndetermine who the high bidder was, and\\nrequested the court to determine the right-\\nful bidder. No sale was reported by her.\\n\\nThe court heard testimony ore tenus and\\nordered a resale of the property. Addi-\\ntionally he ordered the Register to refund\\nMitchell’s deposit, Sarah Stone to begin\\nthe bidding at $8,000 (the reputed fair\\nmarket value of the property) and that she\\ndeposit $1,800 into the court as good faith\\nto guarantee the $8,000 bid. At the sale\\nSarah Stone became the purchaser for\\n$8,000, and the sale was confirmed by the\\ncourt.\\n\\nWe agree with the trial court in\\nhis decree that “Courts must guard against\\nrendering judicial sales unstable by setting\\nthem aside too freely.” But, in this case, |\\nthe court correctly exercised his discretion\\nby ordering a resale because of a mistake\\nand the confusion existing at the first sale.\\nThe mistake in the bidding does not-appear\\nto be the fault of the interested parties.\\nConsequently the trial court, in confirming\\nthe resale, acted with fairness and pru-\\ndence. We also observe that the differ-\\nence between Mitchell’s bid and the value\\nof the property is $3,500.

We were in\\nthe process of traveling from our apart-\\nment to the home of our parents. It was\\nraining and the roads were wet. We\\nwere approaching what appeared, at a\\ndistance, to be a railroad crossing. I\\ncould not tell that 5th Street did not\\ncross a railroad tracks. There were not\\nany traffic control signs of any kind to\\nwarn us that 5th Street did not cross the\\nrailroad tracks, There were no barri-\\ncades or guard rails to warn an automo-\\nbile driver that 5th Street did not contin-\\nue across the railroad tracks. We were\\ntraveling within the speed limt. By the\\ntime we were close enough to see that\\nSth Street did not cross the railroad\\ntracks, it was too late to stop our auto-\\nmobile. Our automobile collided with\\nthe railroad tracks and with the gravel\\nand dirt on either side of the railroad\\ntracks.”\\n\\nBased on the facts set out in the affida-\\nvits, it appears that plaintiffs were faced\\nwith an illusion created by the proximity\\nof the street upon which they were driving\\nto the railroad tracks of defendant rail-\\nroads. The rainy weather conditions and\\nthe sharpness of a right turn in the road\\nallegedly prevented plaintiffs from perceiv-\\ning that the road did not cross the tracks\\nuntil too late to prevent their leaving the\\nroad and hitting the tracks.\\n\\nThe complaint was originally filed by\\nplaintiffs against “Southern Railway Com-\\npany, a corporation, L & N Railroad Com-\\npany, a corporation, and the City of\\nHuntsville, Alabama, a municipal corpora-\\ntion.” In the complaint, plaintiffs first\\n\\n1. “No city or town shall be Hable for damages\\nfor injury done to or wrong suffered by any\\nperson or corporation, unless said injury or\\nwrong was done or suffered through the\\nneglect, carelessness, or unskillfulness of some\\nagent, officer, or employe of the municipality\\nengaged in work therefor; and while acting\\nin the line of his duty, or unless the said\\ninjury or wrong was done or suffered through\\nthe neglect, carelessness, or failure to remedy\\nsome defect in the streets, alleys, publie ways,\\nor buildings after the same had been called\\n\\ncharged the city with liability for its “ne-\\nglect, carelessness [or] failure * * *\\nto remedy some defect in the streets, alleys\\nor public ways * * * after the same\\nhad been called to the attention of the\\nCouncil of the City of Huntsville, * * *\\nor after the same had existed for such un-\\nreasonable length of time as to raise a pre-\\nsumption of knowledge of such defect on\\nthe part of the Council.”\\n\\nThe complaint then charged negligence\\non the part of defendant railroads for al-\\nlowing or permitting “a situation to exist\\nso that it appeared to a motorist that 5th\\nStreet located in the City of Huntsville,\\nAlabama, crossed the railroad tracks\\nowned and operated by these defendants”\\nand for failing “to properly maintain their\\nrailroad tracks * * *.”\\n\\nThe defendant railroads were subse-\\nquently dismissed from the suit on plain-\\ntiffs’ motion after a settlement agreement\\nwas reached between plaintiffs and rail-\\nroads and pro tanto releases executed.\\nThe city moved for summary judgment,\\nciting ;Title 37, §§ 502-03 of the Alabama\\nCode, and the trial court granted the mo-\\ntion, The issue before this court on appeal\\nis whether the trial court’s action in grant-\\ning the motion was correct.\\n\\nThe language used by plaintiffs in their\\nallegation of liability against the City of\\nHuntsville is taken directly from Title 37,\\nsection 502, Code of Alabama (Recompiled\\n1958).1 The liability created by this stat-\\nute was thoroughly delineated by this court\\nin the case of City of Birmingham v.\\nCarle, 191 Ala. 539, 68 So. 22 (1915). In\\nhis opinion, Justice McClellan described\\n\\n“to the attention of the council, or after the\\nsame had existed for such unreasonable length\\nof time as to raise a presumption of knowledge\\nof such defect on the part of the council,\\nand whenever the city or town shall be made\\nliable to an action for damages, by reason of\\nthe unauthorized or wrongful acts, or the\\nnegligence, carelessness, or unskillfulness of\\nany person or corporation, then such person\\nor corporation shall be liable to an action\\non the same account by the party so injured.”\\n\\n\\n383\\n\\nthis statute as establishing two classes of\\nliability:\\n\\n“In the first class (a) are wrongs or in-\\njuries resulting from negligence of\\nagents, etc., of the municipality, consist-\\nent with the doctrine of respondeat supe-\\nrior; and in the second class (b) are\\nwrongs or injuries for which the munici-\\npalities are only liable for culpable ne-\\nglect to remedy a condition negligently\\ncreated or made or allowed to exist by a\\nperson or corporation not related in\\nservice to the municipality—a stranger\\nto the municipal service or function.”\\n191 Ala. at 542, 68 So. at 23.\\n\\nThe opinion also describes the require-\\nments of section 503,2 which must be read\\nin pari materia with section 502:\\n\\n“[Section 503] requires that, where the\\nmunicipality is sued, the person or corpo-\\nration within the second class (b) de-\\nfined in section [502] shall be joined as\\na defendant, unless on appropriate de-\\n‘mand the name of the so culpable person\\nor corporation (stranger to the municipal\\nservice or function) is not furnished by\\nthe mayor within ten days after the de-\\nmand; and an additional requirement\\nand method for the joinder of such per-\\nson or corporation is provided, where it\\n\\nx\\n\\n“The injured party, if he sues the munici-\\npality for damages suffered by him, shall also\\njoin such other person or persons or corpora-\\ntion so liable as defendant or defendants of\\nthe suit, and no judgment shall be rendered\\nagainst the city or town, unless judgment is\\nrendered against such other person or cor-\\nporation so liable for such injury, except\\nwhere a summons is returned not found as to\\na defendant or when judgment is rendered in\\nhis favor on some personal defense, and if an\\naction be brought against the city or town\\nalone and it is made to appear that any per-\\nson or corporation ought to be joined as a de-\\nfendant in the suit according to the pro-\\nvisions in the preceding section, the plaintiff\\nshall be nonsuited, unless he amends by mak-\\ning such party or corporation a defendant\\nif a resident of the state, but no person shall\\nbe sued jointly with the city or town who\\nwould not be liable separately, irrespective of\\nthis provision. When a judgment shall be ob-\\n\\ndevelops that a person or corporation,\\nwithin the second class (b) defined in\\nsection [502], liable for the consequences\\nof his or its culpable wrong, should have\\nbeen originally joined as a defendant;\\nand the plaintiff\\'s failure to amend, so\\nas to bring in such person or corporation\\nas a defendant requires the nonsuiting of\\nthe plaintiff. .\\n\\n“There is further provision in that\\nstatute (section [503]) forbidding the\\nrendition of judgment against the munic-\\nipal defendant under certain circum-\\nstances. According to this statute (sec-\\ntion [503]),. the circumstances under\\nwhich judgment cannot be rendered\\nagainst the municipal defendant alone\\nare these: Where it is shown that the\\ninjury or wrong for redress of which the\\nplaintiff sues was the proximate result\\nof a defect created or existing by reason\\nof the negligent act or omission of a\\nperson or corporation not related to the\\nmunicipal service or function and for the\\nculpable failure of the municipality, to\\nremedy which defect the municipal de-\\nfendant is made only solely jointly liable\\nwith such culpable person or corporation,\\nunless there have been no service upon\\nthe person or corporation so initially cul-\\npable in the premises, or unless the judg-\\n\\ntained against municipality and the other\\nparty liable as aforesaid, execution shall is-\\nsue against the other defendant or defendants\\nin the ordinary form, and shall not be de-\\nmandable of the city or town unless the other\\ndefendants are insolvent, and the same can-\\nnot be made out of their property, and the\\ncity or town shall pay only so much of the\\nsaid judgment as cannot be collected out of\\nthe other defendants. If the injured party\\nshall, before bringing suit, demand of the\\nmayor of such municipality the name of such\\nother person or persons or corporation as\\nmay be liable jointly with the said municipal-\\nity to such injured party, and if such mayor\\nfail to furnish within ten days from the mak-\\ning of such demand, the name of such person\\nor persons or corporation, so jointly liable,\\nthe said injured party shall not be required to\\njoin such other person as a party defendant\\nwith said municipality in any suit brought to\\nrecover damages for such injuries.”\\n\\n\\n384\\n\\nment is rendered in favor of such-person\\nor corporation on some personal defense\\ninterposed by such person or corporation.\\nThe manifest legislative purpose was to\\nprevent the rendition of judgment\\nagainst the municipality for culpable ne-\\nglect in respect of a condition not initial-\\nly created by it, but for the negligent\\nfailure to remedy which it is made liable.\\nIn other words, where a defendant, with-\\nin the description of the second class (b)\\nof section [502], is joined with the mu-\\nnicipality as a defendant and served with\\nprocess, judgment against the municipali-\\nty alone cannot be rendered, unless the\\nPerson or corporation, whose primary\\nculpable act or omission give rise to and\\naffords the essential basis for the munic-\\nipal neglect to remedy the defect, as de-\\nfined, is also adjudged liable, provided\\nthe liability of such person or corpora-\\ntion is not averted by some personal de-\\nfense.” (Emphasis added).\\n\\n191 Ala, at 542-43, 68 So. at 23-24. In\\nCity of Birmingham v.

Even\\nthough the court found no liability under\\nthe facts of that case, in discussing a city’s\\nduty to place traffic control signs the court\\nstated,\\n\\n“{I]£ a dangerous condition exists out-\\nside the street limits but so near thereto\\nthat it endangers travel thereon because\\nof the want of protecting barriers, warn-\\nings or lights with the probability of in-\\njury therefrom, then the city can be held\\nliable.”\\n\\n263 Ala. at 622, 83 So.2d at 323. Even\\nwhere the city did not cause the defect, if\\nit was not initially caused by the wrongful\\nact of another then the city has a separate\\nduty to either correct the defect or warn\\nmembers of the public of its existence.\\nSee City of Bessemer v. Brantley, 258 Ala.\\n675, 65 So.2d 160 (1953).\\n\\nThis conclusion is also supported by the\\n\\ncourt’s decision in City of Montgomery v.\\n\\n3. The language of the original complaint was verified by reference to the original record of\\nthe Cooper case.\\n\\n\\nFerguson, 207 Ala. 430, 93 So. 4 (1922).\\nThere the complaint was framed in the\\nsame language* as the complaint presently\\nbefore the court, charging the City of\\nMontgomery for its failure to put up\\nwarning signs where a street car trestle in-\\ntersected a railroad cut with a bridge\\nwhich was narrower then the street itself,\\nleaving an open space of four feet between\\nthe trestle and a footbridge that the city\\nmaintained nearby. Plaintiff, walking at\\nnight, fell through this space, down into\\nthe railroad cut, sustaining serious injuries.\\nThe city gave plaintiff the name of the\\nstreet car company and it was joined as a\\ndefendant. An affirmative charge was\\ngiven in favor of the street car company\\nand the city requested a charge that a\\njudgment could not be brought against the\\ncity alone under certain conditions because\\nof section 503, Denial of this charge was\\nupheld by this court in the following lan-\\nguage:\\n\\n“Under the evidence here, a case of\\ninitial negligence on the part of some\\nthird person disconnected with the city\\nwas not presented. If the defendant re-\\nceiver was guilty of any negligence at all\\n(a question, as above stated, we are not\\nin a position to review), it would not\\nhave been an initial wrongdoer, but at\\nmost only jointly and cooperatively negli-\\ngent with the city, and the statute [Tit.\\n7, sections 502, 503] would be without ap-\\nplication.

Mont-\\ngomery Fair Company, Inc., 293 Ala. 686,\\n690, 309 So.2d 818, 821 (1975).\\n\\nHM After a consideration of the plead-\\nings and affidavits before the trial court\\nand in light of the above stated tests for\\nassessing the merits of a motion of sum-\\nmary judgment, it appears to this court\\nthat defendant has not met his burden of\\nshowing that plaintiffs cannot prevail un-\\nder any discernible circumstances. See\\nFolmar v. Montgomery Fair Company,\\nInc., 293 Ala. 686, 690, 309 So.2d 818,\\n822 (1975). Conceivably plaintiffs could\\npresent evidence to show initial negligence\\non the part of the city. Such proof if be-\\nHeved by a jury would take the case from\\nunder the influence of section 503 and\\nwould leave a disputed question of fact for\\nthe jury to determine regarding the liabili-\\nty of the city. On the other hand, if pri-\\nmary liability of the railroads should ap-\\npear upon the trial of the case, a directed\\nverdict or judgment notwithstanding the\\nverdict would be proper.\\n\\nThis court finds that summary judgment\\nwas improperly granted and therefore re-\\nverses,\\n\\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\\n\\nMADDOX, JONES, ALMON and\\n\\nSHORES, JJ., concur.\\n\\nMERRILL, BLOODWORTH, FAULK-\\nNER and EMBRY, JJ., dissenting.\\n\\nBLOODWORTH, Justice (dissenting).\\n\\nThe complaint was filed by plaintiffs\\nagainst “Southern Railway Company, a\\ncorporation,” the “L&N Railroad Compa-\\nny, a corporation” and the “City of Hunts-\\nville, Alabama, a municipal corporation.”\\n\\n4. The language of the complaint is recorded the beginning of the report of the case in 207\\n\\nAla, at 481, 93 So. at 5.\\na\\n\\n\\n386\\n\\nThe complaint charges that defendants\\nSouthern Railway and L&N Railroad neg-\\nligently failed “to properly maintain their\\nrailroad tracks” and “negligently allowed\\nor permitted a situation to exist so that it\\nappeared to a motorist that 5th Street lo-\\ncated in the City of Huntsville, Alabama,\\ncrossed the railroad tracks owned and\\noperated by these Defendants.” It is al-\\nleged that the City of Huntsville failed “to\\nremedy some defect in the streets, alleys or\\npublic ways of the City of Huntsville after\\nthe same had been called to the attention\\nof the Council” or “had existed for such\\nunreasonable length of time as to raise a\\npresumption of knowledge” of the defect.\\nAlthough the complaint does not specify\\nthe exact nature of this defect, it appears,\\nfrom the complaint and affidavits filed by\\n“the plaintiffs, that the accident occurred\\nbecause 5th Street appeared to cross the\\nrailroad tracks when, in fact, it did not do\\nso. Plaintiffs ran off the road and onto\\nthe railroad tracks and were injured.\\n\\nAfter suit was brought, plaintiffs took\\npro tanto releases from the two railroads\\nfor $3,000 each, dismissing them as defend-\\nants over the city’s objection.\\n\\nThe sole assignment of error is whether\\nor not the trial court was correct in grant-\\ning summary judgment for the city.\\n\\nThe defendant city’s contention in the\\ntrial court, and here, is that all those joint-\\nly liable with the municipality are required\\nto be joined in the action and that, when\\nthe railroads were dismissed, summary\\njudgment was proper, citing Tit. 37, § 502\\nand § 503, Code of Alabama 1940, I\\nagree.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs’ position is that the join-\\nder requirement of Tit. 37, § 503 is limited\\nto cases resulting from the initial wrongful\\nact of third parties and the city’s liability\\narises out of a negligent failure to remedy\\nthe defect. It is contended by plaintiffs\\nthat, neither in the complaint nor in the\\npapers supporting summary judgment, do\\nthey state that the city’s liability arises by\\n\\nmeans of a wrongful act or acts by defend-\\nant railroads, Thus, plaintiffs argue that\\nthe action may stand against the city not-\\nwithstanding the railroads were dismissed\\nas defendants, and therefore summary\\njudgment was erroneously granted.\\n\\nI cannot agree with the plaintiffs’ posi-\\ntion. The complaint clearly charges that\\nthe railroads were negligent in failing to\\nproperly maintain their tracks and in negli-\\ngently permitting the situation to exist so\\nthat it appeared that 5th Street crossed the\\nrailroad tracks. The city is charged with\\nfailing to remedy this defect. These charg-\\nes, as well as plaintiffs’ affidavits, clearly\\nshow that this action falls within the sec-\\nond classification of Tit. 37, § 502—when\\nthe wrong charged against the city is its\\nfailure to remedy defects after actual no-\\ntice or constructive knowledge. The next\\nsection requires that the other parties like-\\nwise liable be joined and that “no judg-\\nment shall be rendered against the city or\\ntown, unless judgment is rendered against\\nsuch other person or corporation so liable\\nfor such injury. Tit, 37, § 503.\\n{Emphasis supplied.]\\n\\nIn City of Bessemer v. Brantley, 258\\nAla. 675, 65 So.2d 160 (1953), this Court\\nheld, inter alia:\\n\\n“... The applicable provision of\\nSection 503 is to the effect that, if an\\naction be brought against a city or town\\nalone, and it is made to appear that any\\nperson or corporation ought to be joined\\nas a defendant in the suit according to\\nthe provision of said Section 503, the\\nplaintiff shall be nonsuited unless he\\namends by making such party or corpo-\\nration a defendant, if a resident of the\\nstate, but no person shall be sued jointly\\nwith the city or town who would not be\\nliable separately irrespective of this pro-\\nvision. Section 503, supra, also provides\\nthat the injured party, if he sues a mu-\\nnicipality for damages suffered by him\\nshall also join such other person, or per-\\nsons, or corporation, so liable as de-\\n\\n\\na 387\\nEs\\n\\nfendant or defendants of the suit, and\\nno judgment shall be rendered against\\nthe city or town unless judgment is\\nrendered against such other person or\\ncorporation so liable for such injury, ex-\\ncept where a summons is returned not\\nfound as to a defendant, or when judg-\\nment is rendered in his favor on some\\npersonal defense. . . .”\\n\\nIn City of Birmingham v. Carle, 191\\nAla. 539, 68 So, 22 (1915), this Court also\\nheld, with respect to this selfsame section\\nin the Code of 1907, viz:\\n\\n“4. The manifest legislative\\npurpose was to prevent the rendition of\\njudgment against the municipality for\\nculpable neglect in respect of a condition\\nnot initially created by it . . . um-\\nless the person or corporation, whose\\nprimary culpable act or omission give\\nrise to and affords the essential basis for\\nthe municipal neglect to remedy the de-\\nfect, as defined, is also adjudged liable,\\nprovided the liability of such person or\\ncorporation is not averted by some per-\\nsonal defense.” [Emphasis supplied.]\\n\\nThe reason for enactment of such a re-\\nquirement seems clearly to be the legisla~\\nture’s intention to settle the question of\\nprimary responsibility to the injured party\\nin one suit where both the city and the al-\\nleged responsible other parties are made\\nparties. City of Mobile v. George, 253\\nAla, 591, 45 So.2d 778 (1950). The statute\\n“provides for the compulsory joinder of\\nthe alleged active wrongdoer.” City of\\nMobile v. George, supra.\\n\\nI have written solely to the issues raised\\non this appeal by the parties. No question\\nas to the constitutionality of the Code sec-\\ntions in question nor of their constitutional\\napplication to this case was raised in the\\ncourt below nor here. Therefore, I ex-\\npress no opinion thereon.\\n\\nTo denigrate any notion that this inter-\\npretation of §§ 502 and 503 constitutes a\\ntrap or pitfall for the unwary, it is sug-\\ngested that, by a seasonal and proper\\n\\namendment, the plaintiff could have main-\\ntained an action solely against the city as\\nwas done in Brantley, supra.\\n\\nThe legislature, by enacting these sec-\\ntions has clearly shown that it intended to\\nprovide (when action is brought under the\\nsecond subdivision of § 502) that a plain-\\ntiff must join as defendant such other per-\\nsons so liable so that if judgment of liabili-\\nty is fastened on such other person, the\\ncity will be relieved to the extent the other\\nparty is able to respond in damages. See\\nEditor’s note to §§ 502 and 503, Tit. 37,\\nCode 1940 [Recompiled Code 1958]. See\\nalso Carle, and Brantley, supra. Numerous\\nother cases have contained like language.\\n\\nThese sections have constituted the law\\nof Alabama for nearly seventy years.

J., and JONES, ALMON,\\nand SHORES, JJ., dissent.\\n\\nJONES, Justice (dissenting) :\\n\\nI would grant the writ to review the\\njudgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals\\naffirming the defendant’s conviction. The\\nonly issue under consideration is the trial\\nCourt’s overruling of defendant\\'s objection\\nto the following question:\\n\\n“Now, at the time you said you dyed\\nyour brother’s hair and sideburns in Jan-\\n\\n1. This is not to infer, of course, that a defend-\\nant in a criminal case, by electing to testify\\n\\nuary, 1972, how many days was that after\\nhe escaped from the Georgia penitentia-\\nry?”\\n\\nThe defendant did not take the stand, in-\\nvoking the Brasher rule (Brasher v. State,\\n249 Ala. 96, 30 So.2d 31 (1947) ), which\\nprohibits proof of another offense. This\\nrule recognizes in effect that virtually\\nnothing can be more prejudicial to the de-\\nfendant’s right to a fair trial for one of-\\nfense than proof of another offense for\\nwhich he is not being tried. Defendant, of\\ncourse, takes the risk of this prejudicial\\nevidence when he takes the stand to testify\\nin his own behalf;+ but defendant’s exer-\\ncise of his Constitutional prerogative\\nagainst self incrimination would be ren-\\ndered futile if the State, through other\\nwitnesses, could prove his commission of\\nother offenses. In practical effect, if prej-\\nudicial error could be graded on a scale\\nfrom 1 to 10, what happened here, in my\\nopinion, would be scored 10.\\n\\nGiven the defendant’s failure to testify,\\nthere are only two possibilities for the\\nproper admission of the evidence elicited\\nby the challenged question:\\n\\n1) Was it admissible except for some\\nmissing link such as a required predi-\\ncate which was subject to being con-\\nnected up later?\\n\\n2\\n\\nAlthough otherwise illegal, was the\\nelicited evidence the completion of\\npartial evidence introduced by the de-\\nfendant of a conversation or transac-\\ntion?\\n\\nConnecting Up\\n\\nThe “connecting up” doctrine has no\\nfield of operation where the only offered\\nconnection is the proof of the very element\\n(the other offense) which is inadmissible.\\nOtherwise stated, unless the evidence elicit-\\ned is admissible, except for the missing\\nlink which is offered to be supplied later,\\n\\nin his own behalf, necessarily waives all 5th\\nAmendment rights against self incrimination.\\n\\n\\n394\\n\\nthe offer to connect up cannot render the\\nevidence conditionally admissible. The\\nonly evidence offered by the State by way\\nof connecting up was, “We expect there\\nwill be [evidence that defendant escaped\\nfrom a Georgia prison]”—the very evi-\\ndence that is inadmissible in the first in-\\nstance. See 1 McElroy, The Law of Evi-\\ndence in Alabama, § 13.01 (2d Ed. 1959).\\n\\nCompletion of Partial Evidence\\n\\nThe rule of Logan v. State, 291 Ala. 497,\\n282 So.2d 898 (1973), which allows one\\nparty to introduce otherwise illegal evi-\\ndence to complete partial evidence intro-\\nduced by his opponent of a conversation or\\ntransaction, is inapplicable to this case, be-\\ncause the defendant’s alleged escape from\\nthe Georgia penitentiary is not part of the\\nsame transaction as the defendant\\'s sister’s\\ncutting and dying the defendant’s hair.\\nFrench v. State, 25 Ala.App. 53, 141 So.\\n713, cert. denied, 225 Ala. 8, 141 So. 717\\n(1932), held that the same transaction rule\\n“does not apply to particulars of former\\ntransactions not constituting a part of the\\nres gestae, or tending to shed light on the\\nissues.”\\n\\nI believe that the case of Roberson v.\\nState, 233 Ala. 442, 172 So. 250 (1937),\\ncontrols this case. The Roberson case,\\nwhich excluded testimony on the ground\\nthat the defendant’s proffered testimony\\ndid not concern the same transaction as the\\nState’s testimony, drew a distinction be-\\ntween cause and effect. In Roberson, the\\nState’s witness testified to the quarrel be-\\ntween a murder defendant and the de-\\nceased. The defendant then tried to intro-\\nduce testimony that the quarrel immediate-\\nly followed and resulted from the dece-\\ndent’s allowing his cattle to trample the de-\\nfendant’s crops. The Court held that the\\nalleged trespass of livestock on the defend-\\nant’s crops leading to the quarrel was a\\nseparate transaction from the quarrel even\\nthough it resulted in the quarrel.\\n\\nThe case before us presents an analogy\\nto Roberson, in that the defendant’s al-\\n\\nleged escape from the Georgia penitentiary\\nmay have been the cause of his sister’s cut-\\nting and dying his hair, but it was not the\\nsame transaction and, therefore, does not\\ncome within the Logan rule.\\n\\nFurthermore, without reviewing the en-\\ntire text of the defendant’s sister’s testimo-\\nny, it is not possible to tell whether the de-\\nfendant’s sister’s cutting and dying the de-\\nfendant’s hair was even causally related to\\nthe alleged escape. .\\n\\nI would grant the writ.\\n\\nHEFLIN, C.

J., dissents.\\n\\nFAULKNER, Justice (concurring spe-\\ncially).\\n\\nThe trial court denied bail to Jimmy\\nCarlisle after hearing his petition for ha-\\nbeas corpus. The Court of Criminal Ap-\\npeals affirmed. This court affirmed the\\nappellate court without opinion. I concur\\nspecially by adding my thoughts on the is-\\nsue before the trial court.\\n\\n‘The trial court, after hearing the habeas,\\ncorpus petition for bail, said this:\\n\\n“Well in view of the Grand Jury\\nnotes, and in view of the three felonies\\nof rape and two robberies, and in view\\nof the past record, no bond.”\\n\\nSection 16 of the Constitution of 1901\\nprovides:\\n\\n“That all persons shall, before convic-\\ntion, be bailable by sufficient sureties,\\nexcept for capital offenses, when the\\nproof is evident or the presumption\\ngreat; and that excessive bail shall not\\nin any case be required.”\\n\\nThree prerequisites are necessary to jus-\\ntify the denial of bail in capital cases:\\nThe evidence must be clear and strong,\\nleading a well-guarded and dispassionate\\njudgment to the conclusion (1) that the of-\\nfense has been committed, (2) that the ac-\\ncused is the guilty agent, and (3) that he\\nwould probably be punished capitally if the\\nlaw is administered. Lee v. State, 281 Ala.\\n631, 206 So.2d 875 (1968); Trammell v.\\nState, 284 Ala, 31, 221 So.2d 390 (1969).\\n\\nIn Ex Parte Bynum, 294 Ala. 78, 312\\nSo.2d 52 (1975) this court retained the\\nclassification of capital offenses even\\nthough the death penalty had been out-\\n\\n\\nlawed by Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238,\\n92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). This\\ncourt followed a majority of the State Su-\\npreme Courts’ holding that offenses classi-\\nfied as capital before Furman are still cap-\\nital, and bail can constitutionally be denied.\\n\\nHere the trial court was on sound\\nground by denying bail to Carlisle. But,\\nbe that as it may, the trial judge must have\\nhad in the back of his mind that Carlisle\\nwas a recidivist and to grant him bail\\nwould be turning loose a menace to society.\\n\\nThe whole subject of bail needs a thor-\\nough examination by the legislature, the\\ncourts, and the people of this state, When\\nI say “people”, I mean the whole body pol-\\nitic. The people should not stand idly by,\\n“cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.”\\nWilliam Shakespeare, Julius Caesar. The\\npeople are the government, and until they\\nact in an aggressive and forcefullike man-\\nner, the situation will get worse—not bet-\\nter. Recidivists commit 70% to 80% of all\\ncrimes. Granting bail to a recidivist per-\\nmits him to continue to plague the public,\\nto steal, burglarize, rob, rape, and murder.\\nWe have no “habitual criminal” statutes;\\nwe have no preventive detention statute,\\nand our constitution permits bail as a mat-\\nter of right in all cases except capital of-\\nfenses, before conviction. Recidivism,\\nbeing the core of our problem, is the sub-\\nject that demands instant attention. Bail\\nto a recidivist should be a discretionary\\nmatter with the trial judge, or committing\\nmagistrate, in felony cases, and should be\\neliminated entirely in capital cases.\\n\\nHEFLIN, Chief Justice (dissenting) :\\n\\nI would grant the writ in keeping with\\nthe reasons expressed in my special con-\\ncurrence in Ex Parte Bynum, 294 Ala. 78,\\n312 So.2d 52, 56 (1975).\\n\\n397\\n\\nLA\\n828 $0.24 894\\nIn re J, T.

While the Court\\nof Civil Appeals did make certain “obser-\\nvations” that Act No, 1062 was not uncon-\\nstitutional because the bill which passed\\nthe Legislature was not exactly like the\\none signed by the Governor, the actual\\nholding of that court was that the constitu-\\ntional question had not been properly\\npresented. The Court of Civil Appeals did\\ndiscuss the constitutional question, never-\\ntheless, and I believe that court made a\\ncorrect “observation”—that Act No. 1062\\nwas not void in its entirety because of the\\n\\nvariance. Justice Clopton, in Stein v. Lee-\\nper, 78 Ala. 517 (1885), set out the rule to\\nfollow in such matters:\\n\\n“On what principles shall it be deter-\\nmined, whether the change in the bill, as\\napproved, materially varies in substance\\nand legal effect of the bill as passed by\\nthe General Assembly? A safe and\\npractical rule is the one on which the\\ncourts adjudge a statute unconstitutional\\nin toto or in part. Speaking of statutes\\ncontaining some unconstitutional provi-\\nsions, Judge Cooley says: ‘A statute may\\ncontain some such provisions, and yet\\nthe same act, having received the sanc-\\ntion of all branches of the legislature,\\nand being in the form of a law, may\\ncontain other and salutary provisions,\\nnot obnoxious to any just constitutional\\nexception. It would be inconsistent with\\nall just principles of constitutional law to\\nadjudge these enactments void, because\\nthey are associated in the same act, but\\nnot connected with, or dependent on,\\nothers which are unconstitutional.’ The\\nlearned author thus states the test: ‘If,\\nwhen the unconstitutional portion is\\nstricken out, that which remains is com-\\nplete in itself, and capable of being exe-\\ncuted with the apparent legislative in-\\ntent, wholly independent of that which\\nwas rejected, it must be sustained.’ And\\nthe same rule is applied to a statute,\\nsome parts of which may not have been\\npassed in accordance with the constitu-\\ntional forms, where he says: ‘So, the\\nforms observed in passing it may be suf-\\nficient for some of the purposes sought\\nto be accomplished by it, but insufficient\\nfor others, In any such case, the por-\\ntion which conflicts with the ‘constitu-\\ntion, or in regard to which the necessary\\nconditions have not been observed, must\\nbe treated as a nullity.’ ”\\n\\nBy quashing the writ rather than affirm-\\ning the Court of Civil Appeals, the majori-\\nty has failed to give final review of a new\\n\\n\\n403\\n\\nstatute which will affect the rights of\\nmany employers and employees alike.\\nThat is why I would affirm the case rath-\\ner than quash the writ.\\n\\nJONES, J., concurs.\\n\\nLI\\n822 So.2d 733\\nIn re Ulay Black GRIMES\\n\\nve\\nSTATE.\\n\\nEx parte STATE of Alabama ex rel.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL.\\n\\nsc 1521.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nNov. 20, 1975.\\n\\nWilliam J.

Mullins was convicted of selling\\nmarihuana to an undercover policeman and\\nsentenced to 15 years in the penitentiary.\\nPrior to trial, Mullins’ motion to be treated\\nas a youthful offender (he was 19 years of\\nage) was denied without compliance with\\nthe provisions of the Youthful Offender\\nAct. Accordingly, the Court of Criminal\\nAppeals reversed and remanded the cause\\nfor compliance with the requirements of\\nthe Act. After the investigation and hear-\\ning, youthful offender status was again de-\\nnied by the trial Court, and Mullins’\\nformer conviction as an adult, upon fur-\\nther review by the Court of Criminal Ap-\\npeals, was affirmed.\\n\\nOn preliminary consideration, we grant-\\ned the writ of certiorari to the Court of\\nCriminal Appeals on the limited issue of\\nthe propriety of the trial Judge’s response\\nto the District Attorney’s objection to de-\\nfense counsel’s remarks during summation\\nto the jury.\\n\\nDuring the trial, counsel for Mullins in\\nhis closing argument to the jury said: “I\\nwant to point out to you, now one matter\\nof scripture and that is this, I am reading\\nSecond Corinthians the Thirteenth Chap-\\nter.”\\n\\nThe State objected to counsel’s reading\\nthe Bible to the jury on the ground that it\\nwas not evidence in the case. The follow-\\ning discourse transpired:\\n\\n“MR. WRIGHT: Your honor I hate to\\ninterrupt the argument, but I think that\\n\\nit is improper for Mr. Gullage to read\\nfrom the scripture, here, that is not in\\nevidence in this case and it has nothing\\nwhatsoever to do with this case. And I\\nthink it’s improper argument to read\\nfrom the scripture.\\n\\n“THE COURT: Well, Jesus Christ him-\\nself said, render unto God the things\\nthat are God’s and render unto Caesar\\nthe things that are Caesar’s. Now, I in-\\nterpret that from the Bible to mean that\\nwhen there are laws of the land a person\\nis supposed to obey the laws of the land\\nand render unto God the things that are\\nGod’s, but render unto Caesar, that is\\nthe Government, the things that the\\nGovernment has ordered and ordained.\\n\\n“MR. GULLAGE: Your Honor, of\\ncourse, I take exception to your remarks\\nbut I can’t disagree with you.\\n\\n“THE COURT: Well, do you disagree\\nwith Jesus Christ Himself, who said ren-\\nder unto God the things that are Gods,\\n(sic) and render unto Caesar the things\\nthat are Caesar’s?\\n\\n“MR. GULLAGE: No, sir, I don’t disa-\\ngree with it I just take exception to the\\nremarks of the Court—\\n\\n“THE COURT: Well, now, maybe you\\nare not as busy as I am, I work Satur-\\ndays, and Sundays, and nights, and every\\nother time, and don’t have a chance to\\ngo to Church, I’m down in my office\\never (sic) Sunday—\\n\\n“MR. GULLAGE: Your Honor, I’m not\\ndoubting what you say about that, I just\\nexcept to the remarks by the Court to the\\njury.\\n\\n“THE COURT: All right. Now, go\\nahead and read the bible to the jury,\\nI’m a firm believer in Jesus Christ my-\\nself.” 1\\n\\nOnly one interpretation can be given to\\nthe trial Judge’s remarks, “Now, I inter-\\npret that from the Bible to mean that when\\nthere are laws of the land a person is sup-\\nposed to obey the laws of the land and ren-\\n\\n1. It should be noted that the propriety of the trial Court’s ruling is not the issue here pre-\\n\\nsented,\\n\\n\\n414\\n\\nder unto God the things that are God’s, but\\nrender unto Caesar, that is the Govern-\\nment, the things that the Government has\\nordered and ordained.” This could only\\nhave the effect of urging the jury to ren-\\nder up defendant Mullins to the govern-\\nment for his due punishment. Rather than\\nlimiting his response to the ruling on the\\nDistrict Attorney’s objection, the trial\\nJudge anticipated defense counsel’s argu-\\nment and responded in the nature of a re-\\nply. This is clearly a violation of the ad-\\nmonition that the trial judge should not as-\\nsume an adversary role in the trial of\\nwhich he is presiding,\\n\\nIn the trial arena, a wide and distinct\\nline separates advocacy—the role assigned\\nto trial counsel—from the functions of the\\npresiding judge. It is the separation of\\nthese two roles that safeguards the funda-\\nmental fairness and impartiality mandated\\nby the State and Federal Constitutions.\\nTo be sure, the myriad duties and responsi-\\nbilities of the presiding judge necessarily\\nvests in him much discretion in the conduct\\nof the trial; but this discretion does not\\npermit him to cross that line and in effect\\ndescend the bench and assume a role which\\nthe system in its wisdom has assigned to\\nothers, It is the sworn duty of the jury to\\nfollow the instruction of the trial judge,\\nand thus his remarks in their presence\\nmust never be flavored with partiality as\\nbetween the parties litigant. Moulton v.\\nState, 199 Ala. 411, 74 So. 454 (1917);\\nHolland v. State, 24 Ala.App. 199, 132 So.\\n601 (1931); Dennison v. State, 17 Ala.\\nApp. 674, 88 So. 211 (1921).\\n\\nThe opinion of the Court of Criminal\\nAppeals, after correctly reviewing the law,\\nconcludes that the Judge’s remarks were\\nnot intended as a reflection on defense\\ncounsel. The rule is not so limited and the\\nerror, in my opinion, here lies not in any\\nreflections by the trial Court upon counsel,\\nbut in assuming an adversary role before\\nthe jury.\\n\\nI do not interpret the denial of the writ\\nby the majority as condoning the remarks\\n\\nof the trial Judge. Nor do I so interpret\\nthe opinion of the Court of Criminal Ap-\\npeals. The majority simply feels that such\\nremarks are not of such character as to\\nconstitute prejudicial error. I feel, how-\\never, that a disinterested trial judge is so\\nfundamental to the constitutional guarantee\\nof fair trial that this Court should not\\nplace a burden upon the defendant to dem-\\nonstrate specificallly how such remarks\\nprejudiced him, The possibility for preju-\\ndice is inherent whenever a presiding\\njudge assumes an adversary posture, but\\nspecific proof of prejudice is always diffi-\\ncult in a jury trial. Because of the vital\\nimportance of conducting impartial crimi-\\nnal trials, I feel that prejudice should be\\nassumed in this case.\\n\\nFAULKNER, J,, concurs.\\n\\n827 So.2d 740\\nIn re Troy Murphy OATSVALL\\n\\nve\\nSTATE of Alabama,\\n\\nEx parte Troy Murphy Oatsvall.\\nSC 1676.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nMareh 5, 1976.\\n\\nJ.

Courts, in their\\ninterpretation of taxing authority, tend to\\nbe taxpayer oriented. This is more than\\npersonal philosophy; it is indeed a rule of\\nlaw. But it is also a well-established prin-\\nciple that the law looks to substance rather\\nthan form. In denying certiorari, the ma-\\njority of this Court, in my opinion, not\\nonly hails as victorious form over sub-\\nstance but adorns the victor with armor of\\npretense and subterfuge.\\n\\nBy excluding the applicability of Tit. 51,\\n§ 786(34) (i) and (m), Code,! the Court of\\nCivil Appeals makes clear that its opinion\\nis hinged totally on’ an interpretation of\\nState Department of Revenue Departmen-\\ntal Rule G27-916, 56 Ala.App. 661, 325 So.\\n2d 171.\\n\\nI respectfully disagree with the Court of\\nCivil Appeals’ interpretation of this admin-\\nistrative rule in two particulars: First, the\\nopinion accords to the Rule full legal cre-\\ndence and treats its language as having the\\nsame weight and effect as statutuory tax-\\ning authority. This is contrary to the\\nwell-established law of this State. Second,\\nassuming the validity of Rule G27-916, I\\nbelieve its language, properly construed, is\\nfully supportive of the State’s position im-\\nposing the tax.\\n\\nRULE G27-916 AS LAW\\n\\nIt is axiomatic that the levying section\\nof the Sales Tax Act and any exemptions\\nthereunder and under the Cater Act (au-\\n\\nthorizing Industrial Boards), and not an_\\n\\nadministrative rule, must govern. The ap-\\nplicable section of the Sales Tax Act (Tit.\\n51, § 786(25)) provides that the tax is lev-\\nied on the “purchaser” and “consumer”\\nwho actually buys and pays for the tangi-\\nble personal property purchased at retail.\\n\\n1. Subsection (84) (i) of the sales tax levying\\nsection of the statute exempts incorporated\\nmunicipalities, and subsection (34)(m) ex-\\nempts “educational institutions and agencies\\n\\nThe only exemption in the statutes\\nwhich could possibly have any bearing on\\nthis case is found in § 11 of Act No. 648,\\nActs of Alabama 1949 (Cater Act), Tit. 37,\\n§ 825. This provides that the corporation\\n(the Industrial Board) and its properties\\nand income therefrom are exempt from\\ntaxation in this State.\\n\\nThis section creates the exemption here\\nclaimed or no exemption exists in favor of\\nthe transaction in question. Departmental\\nRule G27-916 exempts industrial boards\\n“from sales or use tax on any tangible per-\\nsonal property purchased by the board,\\nprovided the purchases were made in the\\nname of the board and the board’s credit is\\nobligated.” The Court of Civil Appeals’\\nopinion holds that the criteria set forth in\\nthis administrative rule has been met quali-\\nfying Allied for the tax exemption.\\n\\nClearly, then, what the Court of Civil\\nAppeals’ opinion has done is to use the test\\nformulated by Rule G27-916 to construe\\nthe Cater Act exemption (Tit. 37, § 825) to\\nthe sales tax levy (Tit. 51, § 786(25)).\\nThe problem with this reasoning is that the\\nopinion’s conclusion places the test set\\nforth in the rule in conflict with the stat-\\n\\nite, This gives to the rule a different and\\nconflicting construction to that authorized\\nby the statute.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION OF RULE G27-916\\n\\nI believe that an examination of the\\nRule, in conjunction with the exemption\\nstatute from which the Rule necessarily\\nemanates, shows that the Rule is not in\\nconflict with, but rather an aid to the ad-\\nministration of, the basic statutes. The\\nlevying statute imposes a sales or use tax\\non the purchaser or consumer with no ex-\\nemption here applicable. The Cater Act\\nprovides that the corporation (Industrial\\nBoard) is exempt from taxation by the\\nState. The administrative regulation (De-\\n\\nof . . . any incorporated municipality\\n-”. Both subsections were relied upon\\nby Allied and properly rejected by the Court\\n\\nof Civil Appeals,\\n\\n\\n422\\n\\npartmental Rule G27-916) seeks to set\\nforth guidelines governing the relationship\\nof the Board to the industrial lessee (Al-\\nlied) as to who is in fact such purchaser or\\nconsumer.\\n\\nInitially, when the Board used its bond\\nissue capital to build and equip for lease\\nthe paper mills in question, no tax incident\\noccurred nor was any claimed. The rule\\nand its parent statute consistently so man-\\ndate. Here, however, with like constancy\\nthe Rule creates a tax incident unless the\\nlaw is willing to indulge in the most bla-\\ntant of fictions. .\\n\\nIn my humble opinion, appellate court\\njudges ought to be presumed to know at\\nleast as much as the average man on the\\nstreet. Applying this simple test, I know\\nfrom the stipulation of facts before us that\\n\\n. the Board was not, and could not have\\nbeen, either the purchaser or the consumer\\nof the machinery in question.” The Board\\nneither bought, claims, nor uses the proper-\\nty. Its only revenue—rentals from Allied\\n—is legally committed to the retirement of\\nthe bonded indebtedness. The fact that the\\nmachinery was bought “on credit”, rather\\n\\n. than by a cash transaction, is a far cry\\nfrom obligating the credit of the Board.\\nIndeed, this was legally impossible. The\\nBoard can do only what its charter author-\\nizes and it certainly cannot buy what it\\ncannot pay for. °\\n\\nAllied, on the other hand, bought the\\nproperty through the Board as its agent,\\npaid for it, claimed it, used it, and depre-\\nciated it for income tax purposes. If these\\n\\nfacts do not constitute Allied as the pur- -\\n\\nchaser and consumer, then all my powers of\\nreasoning and logic, and my common sense\\nhave eluded me.\\n\\nTake, for example, the-income tax de-\\npreciation incident: Allied claims the\\nproperty for this purpose and consequently\\npays less State (and Federal) corporate in-\\ncome tax. But it disavows ownership for\\nsales or use tax purposes. To this blatant\\ninconsistency, the trial Court, and now the\\nCourt of Civil Appeals and the Supreme\\nCourt have said, “We agree.” And the\\nonly factual basis for such conclusion is\\nthe pretense that the Board purchased the\\nmachinery and obligated its credit therefor\\nby using the Board’s purchase order form.\\n\\nIt is important—indeed crucial—that the\\nlaw itself be honest; and, above all else,\\n\\n. that it give the appearance of being hon-\\n\\nest. The very essence of legal integrity\\ncertainly consists of treating matters in\\ntheir reality and not in creating nor in-\\ndulging fiction or fancy. The rule of law\\nmust not only endure, it must prevail; and\\nit can do so only so long as it merits and\\nmaintains the understanding and respect of\\nits citizenry. Nothing generates disrespect\\nfor the law more than its unequal applica~\\ntion or its tolerance for subterfuge.\\n\\nI would grant the writ and hold that Al-\\nlied is liable to the State of Alabama on\\nthe sales tax assessment by the Revenue\\nDepartment in the amount of $17,493.71.\\n\\nFAULKNER, J., concurs.\\n\\nALMON, Justice (dissenting) :\\n\\nI think the writ should issue so that this\\nCourt could give further consideration to\\nthe question presented by the petition for\\nwrit of certiorari. At this stage of the\\nproceeding, however, I do not consider it\\nappropriate to express a final view as the\\nentire record is not before us.\\n\\nLL]\\n327 So.2d 927\\nIn re STATE of Alabama\\n\\nve\\nRobert Spencer BURNS,\\nEx parte State of Alabama.\\nSC 1670.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\\nMarch 5, 1976.\\n\\nWilliam J.

      "{'id': 54856, 'name': 'United States v. Mead Corporation', 'description': None, 'document': 'Facts: Under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, the United States Customs Service is authorized to classify and fix the rate of duty on imports under rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. Under the Secretary\\'s regulations, any port-of-entry Customs office and the Customs Headquarters Office may issue \"ruling letters\" setting tariff classifications for particular imports. The Mead Corporation\\'s imported \"day planners,\" were classified as duty-free until the Customs Headquarters issued a ruling letter classifying them as bound diaries subject to tariff. Subsequently, Mead filed suit in the Court of International Trade. The court granted the Government summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Appeals found that ruling letters should not be treated like Customs regulations, which receive the highest level of deference, because they are not preceded by notice and comment as under the Administrative Procedure Act, do not carry the force of law, and are not intended to clarify importers\\'s rights and obligations beyond the specific case. The court gave no deference at all to the ruling letter at issue.\\nQuestion: Does a tariff classification ruling by the United States Customs Service deserve judicial deference?\\nConclusion: No. In an 8-1 opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that the \"administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for [the greatest level of deference accorded under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council] when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\" Justice Souter wrote that \"a tariff classification has no claim to judicial deference under Chevron, there being no indication that Congress intended such a ruling to carry the force of law, but we hold that under Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., the ruling is eligible to claim respect according to its persuasiveness.\"'}\n"

      "1916Document 0: I do want to emphasize, though, that my friends have pointed to January 19th or nine days from now as a moment when TikTok might go dark.\n",
      "At the outset, of course, Congress was hoping to prompt a divestiture, but I think the more important thing to  --to focus on now is that even if that were to happen, Congress specifically anticipated it and provided authority to lift these restrictions as soon as there's a qualified divestiture.\n",
      "And the reason for that is because foreign adversaries do not willingly give up their control over this mass communications  channel in the United States, and I think Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken, ByteDance saying we can't do it; China will never let us do it.\n",
      "But, when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider, and it might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process.\n",
      " Well, that's --\n",
      " So it's not irrevocable.\n",
      " That  --that's an interesting point, and I hope Mr. Francisco or Mr. Fisher, whoever's delivering the rebuttal, will address it.\n",
      "So, if we were to affirm and TikTok were forced to cease operations on January 19th, you say that there could be divestiture after that point and TikTok could again begin to operate the way -- continue to operate?\n",
      " That's exactly right.\n",
      "There's nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens on January 19th.\n",
      "And I think that  Congress might have thought that we get in a situation here where a foreign adversary is doing whatever it can to just not comply.\n",
      "It's  hoping the United States is going to blink first through our court system or through the executive branch getting cold feet about enforcing the law.\n",
      "But Congress set a deadline  and I think it thought that deadline would have a forcing function.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1891Document 1: But Congress set a deadline  and I think it thought that deadline would have a forcing function.\n",
      " Let me ask you a question about your  -- your effort to draw a distinction between ByteDance's speech and TikTok's speech.\n",
      "So suppose that the -- the People's Republic of China funds a movie and  --and there is an entity in the United States , a U.S. corporation, that thinks, wow, this is a great movie.\n",
      "And while the PRC would not have a First Amendment right to show it in the United States, would you say that the American company would not have a First Amendment right to do that because whatever expression there is in that movie, it's the PRC's expression; it's not their expression?\n",
      " No.\n",
      "No, I wouldn't make that argument.\n",
      "And I want to be really  careful --\n",
      " I thought that was the argument that was being made.\n",
      "No?\n",
      " No.\n",
      "So our argument is that this is not a direct regulation of protected speech in the first place, or at most, it would warrant intermediate scrutiny because of the indirect effects that it might have on the American users or on the U.S. subsidiary.\n",
      "We're not suggesting that if Congress sought to directly regulate and prohibit speech in the United States based on concerns about its content or viewpoint, that's somehow immune from First Amendment scrutiny just because it comes from a foreign source.\n",
      "Obviously, that kind of law is going to trigger strict scrutiny.\n",
      "And I imagine it would be a different constitutional analysis because it's hard to imagine the same profound national security harms that would exist in that scenario as compared to what we have here.\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      " General, isn't the whole point of the divestiture requirement that  the content on TikTok would be different if it was owned by a different company?  I'm still  struggling with your insistence that this is content-neutral versus content -based when we have that kind of circumstance.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1944Document 2: The reason that I am continuing to try to hold the line on that is because there is nothing in the Act that would directly dictate any different mix of content on TikTok.\n",
      "The U.S. subsidiary could use the same algorithm, show the same content by the same users in exactly the same order.\n",
      "It's not about trying to interfere with the U.S. subsidiary's exercise of editorial judgment in any relevant sense.\n",
      "Instead, all Congress was doing was homing in on the problems of having a foreign adversary be able to interject itself and be able to harvest the data or exercise --\n",
      " But your friends on the other side say that the motivation for doing that is because the foreign adversary might influence or change the content.\n",
      "So content is  --I mean, content matters, doesn't it?\n",
      " I  -- certainly, I think that content was relevant to Congress's concern about an adversary having control over the communications channel.\n",
      "I think not, again, because of any particular concern about viewpoints or subjects --\n",
      " But isn't that relevance --\n",
      " -- but just that this would be a --\n",
      " -- isn't that relevance enough to trigger at least some scrutiny, a heightened scrutiny, from the standpoint of our legal tests?\n",
      " I certainly understand that intuition, and if the Court thought that it were prudent to simply try to rule narrowly here and not dictate broader First Amendment principles, we have no problem with the Court assuming that heightened scrutiny applies.\n",
      "We think the law easily satisfies it. We do think that intermediate scrutiny is a more appropriate framework for this kind of law that's not directly targeting protected speech. But, in any event, there's a compelling national security interest here, and the law isn't just narrowly tailored; it's precisely tailored.\n",
      "It's trying to fix the thing that's creating the problem, which is the PRC's involvement and the Chinese government's  ability to exercise this control over the corporate entities.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1965Document 3: How are we supposed  to think about the two different rationales here and how they interact, the data collection rationale, which seems to me at least very strong; the covert content manipulation rationale, as the hypotheticals have illustrated, raise much more challenging questions for you about how far that goes.\n",
      "And if that alone  -- if you didn't have the data collection piece, you only had the covert content manipulation piece, and then Mr. Fisher's point, Mr. Francisco's, that Congress would not have enacted this just based on the data collection rationale alone, just your understanding of how the two arguments fit together.\n",
      " Sure.\n",
      "And  -- and let me walk through our defense of the data protection rationale and why we think it's a full justification for this law and the Court could stop there and then be responsive to their  arguments that somehow the interest in preventing covert manipulation somehow taints it.\n",
      "So just on data protection, I think that it should be beyond dispute that, of course, our nation has an enormous interest in keeping the sensitive data out of the hands of our foreign adversary.\n",
      "And it should also be beyond dispute that our foreign adversary has an existing capability through its laws and through the way that these companies are integrated to get its hands on that data.\n",
      "There is no question that Congress was sincerely motivated by that concern.\n",
      "There's a whole lead -up to the statute here where the executive branch across two different presidential administrations was expressing concerns about the data problems.\n",
      "Congress was extensively briefed on those problems.\n",
      "It passed a companion data protection statute at the same time that was intended to prevent selling data to foreign adversary nations.\n",
      "The statute is shot-through with protections that I think are key to this concern about closing off the vulnerability of access to the data.\n",
      "So that's a sincere justification for Congress's desire here to act.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1918Document 4: So that's a sincere justification for Congress's desire here to act.\n",
      "We think it's a compelling interest and it's narrowly tailored.\n",
      "Then you get to the question of what to do about the fact that there's also this interest in covert content manipulation.\n",
      "And in the First Amendment context, this Court in cases like Heffron has made clear that once you have a justification that satisfies the First Amendment, you don't need to go further and look at other justifications to decide whether they would independently satisfy First Amendment scrutiny.\n",
      "So I think it's not necessary for the Court to go on and probe whether it thinks that covert content manipulation itself independently justifies the law.\n",
      "Now my friends say that's all fine and good, but they think covert content manipulation is just per se illegitimate.\n",
      "And I honestly don't understand how that argument could carry  the day because just imagine if Congress passed a law that said the PRC can't covertly manipulate TikTok.\n",
      "Obviously, that law's not  going to violate any constitutional principle.\n",
      "It's a laudable goal, I think, for our legislature to protect us from foreign adversary interference like that.\n",
      "And so there's nothing something -- there's nothing that's in -- inherently impermissible about wanting to  guard against that risk.\n",
      "Maybe you could say that it sweeps in too much protected speech in the way it's operationalized in the Act here, but there's certainly no fundamental taint -- taint or anything akin to racial discrimination to call into question whether Congress could seek to vindicate that as one of many interests.\n",
      "So I guess, to just kind of bring it all together, what I would say to the Court is they have basically acknowledged that data protection is a compelling interest.\n",
      "That was Congress's real interest.\n",
      "It provides a sufficient basis on its own to uphold this law. The Court could say just that and -- and affirm.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1809Document 5: I don't know how we do that unless we accept your argument that the post-divestiture provision that stops them from conferring on the algorithm is not a speech impediment, meaning it -- it's very hard for me  to say that it's not motivate -- to decide that question, that it is a speech impediment and one that on its face itself has to be analyzed separately from the data.\n",
      " So, Justice Sotomayor, let me begin by saying again that we do think that an interest in preventing any operational agreement between the U.S. subsidiary and ByteDance, which is the relevant provision you're talking about, is justified by data protection alone.\n",
      "And that includes with respect to cooperation on a content recommendation algorithm specifically because of the concern that it necessitates data flows between the companies.\n",
      "So I think that as a factual matter, that could justify Congress enacting  --\n",
      " So, if it's  --\n",
      " But, to the extent that you think that actually the prohibition on coordinating with respect to an  algorithm reflects some kind of impermissible content-based problem with the statute, the statute has a severability clause.\n",
      "And I certainly don't think that it would give the Court a basis to invalidate this law or to -- or to stop it from operating with  respect to all of the provisions that operate to protect data security.\n",
      "At most, it would  suggest that that little piece of the law has to be on its own severed from the rest of how the statute operates.\n",
      " How does that affect whether we would apply -- because, assuming it's data protection, then I would think that strict scrutiny wouldn't necessarily apply.\n",
      "I could understand applying intermediate scrutiny.\n",
      "But how do we do that with respect to this part, the algorithm issue?  How do we get to intermediate scrutiny with respect to that?\n",
      "---\n",
      "1992Document 6: The way you get to intermediate scrutiny there is to recognize that prohibiting foreign adversary control over the operations of the platform, including with respect to the fundamental backbone of the system, is not based on any protected speech or  -- or content -based in the relevant sense. I've been thinking of it as akin to something like a piece of software you might  have on your phone that would allow the Chinese government to listen in on every American conversation.\n",
      "If Congress wanted to enact a law  that patched up that vulnerability and said you can't use that piece of software or you can't coordinate with Chinese companies with respect to it, clearly, we would recognize that closing off that capability of China is a laudable and, in fact, compelling government interest.\n",
      "And I think, when it comes to the risks that foreign adversary control pose here, it's similar in kind.\n",
      "It's simply trying to prevent access by the Chinese government  to the TikTok system writ large, and that includes through the use of the algorithm.\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      " Could the president say that we're not going to enforce this law?\n",
      " I think, as a general matter, of course, the president has enforcement discretion.\n",
      " And would that then adequately -- would that be binding, in other words, protect the regulated community  such that it could rely on that under due process principles going forward?\n",
      " That raises a tricky question, so  I think there would be a strong --\n",
      " Well, then it's not going to be adequate, right?\n",
      " Well, I  -- I think there is a strong due process argument that the third-party service providers could invoke if there were enforcement action based on a period of time when the president said the law wouldn't be enforced.\n",
      "The con -- kind of canonical case  --\n",
      " They're not going to take that risk unless they have the assurance that a presidential statement of non-enforcement is, in fact, something that can be fully relied on because the risk is too severe otherwise, right?\n",
      "---\n",
      "1911Document 7: I think that they might judge that based on this Court's precedent  in the due process space and principles of entrapment by estoppel, maybe they have a  sufficient safeguard here to allow them to continue to operate.\n",
      "I would think, even before a non-enforcement policy were announced, of course, the President-Elect would want to review all of the updated national security information that has come in over the last four years that undergird Congress's judgment here.\n",
      "But the final thing I would say is that even if you think the third-party providers are simply going to choose not to continue to provide these services because it's too much of a risk to take on, again, that's not anything permanent or irrevocable, and that might be just what the PRC and ByteDance need to start taking seriously some of the -- the public reporting about interest in acquiring the company.\n",
      " At one point, Mr. Francisco suggested that what we might want to do and what he would regard as certainly preferable to a decision affirming on the merits was  --is to issue an injunction pending, I guess, consideration of what we now regard as the  --as the cert petition that was filed here. What do you think of that suggestion?\n",
      " So I think this Court doesn't have any basis to enter a temporary injunction unless it thinks  Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claim.\n",
      "And, to be honest, you know, I  --I would -- I think that there is no argument to be made that you should find that likelihood of success.\n",
      "This is an act of Congress.\n",
      "This isn't some unilateral action by the executive branch, but it actually was action in parallel between the Executive and Congress where Congress took action to close up a loophole in some of our laws.\n",
      "The Executive had tried to force divestiture of TikTok under the Trump administration, but that had gotten tied up in litigation about those authorities.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1972Document 8: So Congress came in and provided additional authority based on a substantial record, including with respect to the data harm. And I don't see any basis for this Court to displace the deadline that Congress set without finding that actually there is a potential First Amendment problem here.\n",
      " Do -- do you think we have the authority to issue an administrative stay, as we have done in  --in other cases, or do you think that the January 20 deadline prohibits us from doing that?\n",
      " I don't think this Court has a formal basis to not issue an administrative stay if it believed that that was necessary to assist in the Court's own consideration of the case.\n",
      "I would obviously defer to the Court and whether it has  a sufficient time to resolve the case, but we are here ready to submit the case today.\n",
      "And I think it is in the interest of Congress's work and our national security to resolve the case and allow the statute to take effect.\n",
      " Can I just test your  --to see whether your recollection of what Mr. Francisco sa id about a warning is consistent with mine?  I did not hear him say  --he can address this in -- in rebuttal --that it would be acceptable to his client if Congress had said  there has to be a stark warning on every TikTok such as:  Warning, Communist  --Communist China is using TikTok to manipulate your thinking and to gather potential blackmail material.\n",
      "Did you  hear him say that that would be okay?\n",
      " I don't think he's made that concession, but, even if he had, I  don't think that would address the government's national security concerns.\n",
      "And one of the  --the points here is that it's not just data privacy.\n",
      "So, even if you could somehow put users on notice that the PRC could obtain their data and they choose to disregard that, it's not a data privacy interest.\n",
      "It's a national security interest.\n",
      "There's a distinct sovereign harm to the United States if our foreign adversary could collect this massive data set about 170 million Americans.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1945Document 9: And, as Justice Kavanaugh touched on, you know, there are a lot of teenagers using TikTok today who might ignore a warning like that and not really care, but they're going to grow up and they might become members of our military, they might become senior government officials.\n",
      "And for the  -- the Chinese government to have this vast trove of incredibly sensitive data about them I think obviously  exposes our nation as a whole to a risk of espionage and blackmail.\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      " I did want to touch briefly on the questions about history and tradition here because my friends have said  several times that the Communications Act of 1934, which we think is roughly analogous to the type of restriction that Congress was seeking to enact here, is justified entirely by concerns about scarcity, how you can't have sufficient bandwidth.\n",
      "And I, of course, recognize that scarcity is what created the need for a licensing regime in the first place, but I think it's important to clarify the historical record here that in choosing to limit foreign control of radio stations, of broadcast stations, Congress specifically cited a concern about national security.\n",
      "That is written into the statute.\n",
      "National defense was one of the listed purposes of having that kind of restriction. And so I don't think my friends can succeed in being dismissive of that concern about history and tradition and what it shows about the national security judgm ents that undergird this law.\n",
      "The one other factual point I wanted to make to be responsive to a few points that my friends have touched on relates to whether TikTok U.S. has the ability to alter this algorithm, whether divestiture is feasible, how ByteDance has manipulated the platform in the past.\n",
      "With respect to the algorithm, I think we're simply talking past each other.\n",
      "We don't dispute that TikTok U.S. might engage in some functions in the United States to customize the algorithm for a U.S. audience.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1838Document 10: The thing we're worried about is happening long before that, over in China, where ByteDance is developing the source code, creating the basic backbone and functioning of the system, and is then blasting out the algorithm for use by the various subsidiaries in their home country.\n",
      "So we're not seeking to regulate any activity that TikTok U.S. is engaged in here. Instead, what Congress is doing is trying to close off the vulnerability of PRC access abroad.\n",
      "With respect to the feasibility of divestiture, my friends have said it would have been impossible to do this within 270 days.\n",
      "You  know, at the outset, obviously, there's no inherent impediment to divesting a social media company.\n",
      "We just saw Elon Musk buy X, or  Twitter, in about  six months from offer to completion.\n",
      "And even with respect to this particular company, I think my friends are not well positioned to complain about the timeline because they've been on notice since 2020 that unless they could satisfy the federal government's national security concerns, divestiture might be required.\n",
      "But, in any event, I don't think that the Court should fault Congress for trying to balance competing interests here in making sure that there was a period for compliance and trying to preserve access to the platform for Americans while taking steps to safeguard against the risk to national security. Finally, with respect to the question of whether ByteDance has taken action on the PRC's demands, there is evidence in the record that Congress consulted to demonstrate that  outside of China, ByteDance has taken action to misappropriate data at the PRC's request.\n",
      "That  included efforts to track dissidents in Hong Kong, protestors there, to track Uyghurs in China itself.\n",
      "We know that ByteDance has  misappropriated U.S. data with respect to surveilling of U.S. journalists.\n",
      "---\n",
      "1921Document 11: And there was evidence in the record reinforcing the conclusion that ByteDance has been asked by the PRC to undertake efforts to censor content and manipulate the platform at the behest of the Chinese government.\n",
      "So I don't think there is a factual basis to dispute the record that Congress had before it.\n",
      "If the Court has no further questions.\n",
      " Justice Thomas?\n",
      " I have a question. General, if I understood correctly, under President-Elect's first term, he passed  an executive order requiring divestiture, correct?\n",
      " That's right.\n",
      " And this -- that was challenged in court and stayed as a result of him exceeding his executive power to do that. But this bill followed a bipartisan investigation, correct?\n",
      " Yes, that's right.\n",
      " I am a little concerned that a suggestion that a president-elect or anyone else should not enforce the law when a law is in effect and has prohibited certain action, that a company would choose to ignore enforcement on any assurance other than the change in that law.\n",
      "But putting that aside, on the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      " And whatever the new president does doesn't change that reality for these companies?\n",
      " That's right.\n",
      " How long is the statute of limitations in effect?  Assuming that they violated it that day and later continued to violate it, but how long does the statute of limitations exist for a civil violation --\n",
      " It  --\n",
      " -- of this sort?\n",
      " It would be a five-year statute of limitations.\n",

Justice Alito also suggested that the legislature enact laws that draw reasonable distinctions regarding when and what information within a phone can be reasonably searched following an arrest.\\nLearn more about the Roberts Court and the Fourth Amendment in Shifting Scales, a nonpartisan Oyez resource.\\n', 'dataset': 'project_oyez', 'description': \"A case in which the Court found that the San Diego Police Department's search of an arrested gang member's cell phone pictures without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\", 'facts_of_the_case': \"David Leon Riley belonged to the Lincoln Park gang of San Diego, California. On August 2, 2009, he and others opened fire on a rival gang member driving past them. The shooters then got into Riley's Oldsmobile and drove away. On August 22, 2009, the police pulled Riley over driving a different car; he was driving on expired license registration tags. Because Riley's driver's license was suspended, police policy required that the car be impounded. Before a car is impounded, police are required to perform an inventory search to confirm that the vehicle has all its components at the time of seizure, to protect against liability claims in the future, and to discover hidden contraband. During the search, police located two guns and subsequently arrested Riley for possession of the firearms. Riley had his cell phone in his pocket when he was arrested, so a gang unit detective analyzed videos and photographs of Riley making gang signs and other gang indicia that were stored on the phone to determine whether Riley was gang affiliated. Riley was subsequently tied to the shooting on August 2 via ballistics tests, and separate charges were brought to include shooting at an occupied vehicle, attempted murder, and assault with a semi-automatic firearm.\\nBefore trial, Riley moved to suppress the evidence regarding his gang affiliation that had been acquired through his cell phone. His motion was denied. At trial, a gang expert testified to Riley's membership in the Lincoln Park gang, the rivalry between the gangs involved, and why the shooting could have been gang-related. The jury convicted Riley on all three counts and sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison. The California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, Division 1, affirmed.\\n\", 'id': 62258, 'name': 'Riley v.
